now, therefore, be it,Resolved, That the Board of Education denounces the rise in anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, and anti- Israeli rhetoric and hate-motivated crimes and incidents that denigrate Jewish students and staff in the communities served by LAUSD in order for every LAUSD campus and office to be a safe and welcoming environment for all students, staff, and families;Resolved further, The Board declares the need for updated bulletins, curricular and instructional resources, and training for teachers, staff, administrators, students, and parents to address and prevent anti-Semitism and respond when anti-Semitic vandalism, bullying, harassment, or violence occurs either on campus or in the community, including specific reference to anti-Semitism in the mandated bulletins training at the start of each school year;Resolved further, That LAUSD will proceed with full implementation of the California-adopted History Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (2017) and its Appendix F on Religion and History-Social Science Education educate LAUSD students and all elementary, middle, and high school history-social science teachers about the positive contributions of Jewish peoples and to reduce anti-Jewish hate speech and hate-motivated behavior and incidents, and, be it finally;Resolved, That to accomplish these objectives, the Board directs the Superintendent to (1) direct all schools and offices to affirm the rights of Jewish students, staff, and families and to report acts of anti-Semitism in schools and the workplace using District procedures; (2) ensure that the Division of Instruction and Office of Human Relations, Diversity, and Equity establish a curriculum and professional development working group to recruit and compensate LAUSD teachers and administrators with expertise in the areas of Jewish history and culture and the Holocaust, and invite other expert groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, Simon Wiesenthal Center and J Street to update and revise any existing LAUSD curriculum, recommended grade level reading lists, or instructional resources to ensure they are inclusive and reflective of best practices and the full diversity of Jewish people including those in California and Los Angeles, and (3) report back to the Board within 90 days with an update on these efforts.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":15,"meeting_date":"2021-07-13","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Governance & Policy","Equity & Access","Resolutions & Recognitions"]}}
