Doe (1982), the United States Supreme Court held that all immigrant children are people “in any ordinary sense of the term” and hence protected from discrimination under the 14th Amendment, and that all children, regardless of their immigration status, have the right to a free public education; Whereas, The California Constitution, Article 1, Section 28(f)(1) states, “All students and staff of public primary, elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, and community colleges, colleges, and universities have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, secure, and peaceful;” andWhereas, On May 9, 2017 the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District passed the resolution, “Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-093-16/17), and this resolution prohibited District personnel from voluntarily cooperating in any immigration enforcement action, including sharing information about students’ and families’ immigration status with any immigration agent or agency; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms the policy established under Res-093-16/17; Resolved further, That within the next 60 days, the Superintendent shall develop and share with the Board a plan for strong implementation of this policy from the beginning of the next Presidential administration; Resolved further, That this plan shall include advocacy for and an exploration of all possible legal protections for District employees who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or who are otherwise in an immigration status that may be vulnerable to federal attacks, in coordination with city, county and state agencies and legal organizations;Resolved further, That this plan shall include training for all teachers, administrators, and other staff on how to respond to Federal agencies and any immigration personnel who request information about students, families, and staff, and/or are attempting to enter school property, as well as a thorough effort to communicate the District’s sanctuary policy and plan to all District families in the language that they speak; and, be it finallyResolved, That the District will aggressively oppose any effort to create Federal laws, policies, or practices that require school districts to cooperate with Federal agencies and immigration personnel in any way related to immigration enforcement action.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":6,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":1,"meeting_id":52,"meeting_date":"2024-11-19","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"ABSENT"}],"topics":["Equity & Access","Governance & Policy","Appointments"]}}
