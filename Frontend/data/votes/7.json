Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice, and as a result announced “Negro History Week” in 1925 to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans; Whereas, It is commonly stated that Carter G. Woodson selected February as the month to host “Negro History Week” because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history, namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, whose birthdays are February 12th and 14th respectively; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men; he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race, not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization;Whereas, Since 1976, the commemoration was extended from a week-long event to the entire month of February; Whereas, Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history; Whereas, The legacy of Carter G. Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), an organization now in its Centennial Year; Whereas, The 2020 theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is “African Americans and the Vote;”Whereas, The story of America and the continuous fight for voting rights cannot be told without reflecting on the 20 enslaved Africans from the nations of Ndongo and Kongo who arrived in the English Colony of Virginia in August, 1619;Whereas, The year 2020 marks the sesquicentennial of the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) and the right to vote for Black Men after the Civil War; Whereas, The year 2020 also marks the centennial of the Nineteenth Amendment and the culmination of the women’s suffrage movement;Whereas, The story of the struggle for equal citizenship for African Americans can be documented by the significance of the important contribution of black suffragists occurred not only within the larger women’s movement, but within the larger black voting rights movement;Whereas, The 2020 Black History Month theme, African Americans and the Vote, has a rich and long history, which begins at the turn of the nineteenth century, i.e., in the era of the Early Republic, with the states’ passage of laws that democratized the vote for white men while disfranchising free black men;Whereas, Even before the Civil War, black men petitioned their legislatures and the US Congress, seeking to be recognized as voters;Whereas, Tensions between abolitionists and women’s suffragists first surfaced in the aftermath of the Civil War, while black disfranchisement laws in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries undermined the guarantees in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments for the great majority of southern blacks until the Voting Rights Act of 1965; Whereas, Through voting-rights campaigns and legal actions from the turn of the twentieth century to the mid-1960s, Black Americans made their voices heard as to the importance of the vote and indeed continues in the courts today; andWhereas, Our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written, but Black Americans have continuously fought to make them true; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month;Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black Culture, Black Advocacy and Black Civic Engagement; Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to promote and encourage all eligible students to begin their public engagement and pre-register to vote at age 16 and 17 and register all 18 year old students to vote; Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to convene a committee or working group to identify strategies and tactics to align resources targeted toward closing the gap of academic achievement outcomes for Black Students, and, be it finallyResolved, That the Superintendent will work with educators, librarians, all the schools of the District, and the community to recognize and celebrate this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that generate in-depth discussion of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":2,"meeting_date":"2020-02-04","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":11,"full_name":"Richard Vladovic","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Resolutions & Recognitions","Equity & Access"]}}
