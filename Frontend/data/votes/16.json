Whereas, The attention of racially motivated crimes has caused many elected officials, public agencies, corporations, national brands, and organizations to issue statements, adjust operating practices, and make strategic investments in local communities to underscore the declarative statement that “Black lives matter”;Whereas, The current climate of racial unrest has amplified the importance for educators to embrace anti-racist and anti-Black practices in school curricula and operating practices;Whereas, The District’s community of schools and civic partnerships support our students’ in and out of classroom needs;
