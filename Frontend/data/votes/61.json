{"success":true,"vote":{"id":61,"item_number":"020-21/22","title":"Celebrating Black History Month (Res-020-21/22) (Waiver of Board Rule 72)","description":"Whereas, Black History Month, or National African American History Month, is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice, and as a result, announced “Negro History Week” in 1925 to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans; Whereas, It is commonly stated that Carter G. Woodson selected February as the month to host “Negro History Week” because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history, namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, whose birthdays are February 12th and 14th respectively; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men; he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race, not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization; Whereas, Since 1976, the commemoration was extended from a week-long event to the entire month of February; Whereas, The legacy of Carter G. Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), an organization now in its 106th year; Whereas, The 2022 theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is “Black Health and Wellness;” Whereas, This theme acknowledges the legacy of not only Black scholars and medical practitioners in Western medicine but also other ways of knowing (e.g., birth workers, doulas, midwives, naturopaths, herbalists, etc.) throughout the African Diaspora. The 2022 theme considers activities, rituals, and initiatives that Black communities have used to be well;Whereas, The Black family has been disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 virus because of the lack of health equity and a lack of understanding and appropriately addressing the needs of all populations; Whereas, The Black community offers a rich tapestry of health professionals such as James McCune Smith, Rebecca Lee Crumpler, Mary Eliza Mahoney, Daniel Hale Williams, Solomon Carter Fuller, Charles R. Drew, Otis Boykin, Jane Cook Wright, Jocelyn Elders, and Kizzmekia Corbett to name a few; andWhereas, Our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written, but Black Americans have continuously fought to make them true; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month; Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of Black medical professionals and essential workers;  Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to ensure our working groups, departments, and divisions work to identify strategies and tactics to align resources targeted toward championing preventive care and focus on body positivity, physical exercise, nutrition, emotional and mental health along with our anti-racist educational practices and closing the gap of academic achievement outcomes for Black Students; and, be it finally Resolved, That the Superintendent will work with educators, librarians, all the schools of the District, and our wider community to recognize and celebrate this month with culturally relevant and appropriate curriculum, programs, ceremonies, and activities that generate in-depth discussion of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":23,"meeting_date":"2022-01-25","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Resolutions & Recognitions","Governance & Policy","Equity & Access"]}}
