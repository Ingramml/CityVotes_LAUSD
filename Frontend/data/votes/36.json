California and later reiterated by the California Department of Education and the State Board of Education;Whereas, In a 2013 report on the Williams v. California (2004) settlement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) noted the State had failed its obligation regarding school facilities and that schools were facing an impending crisis as insufficient budgets forced many of the highest needs schools to reduce maintenance and custodial staff. These budget cuts and staffing reductions made it increasingly difficult to maintain facilities in good repair and accumulating a backlog of deferred maintenance projects due to lack of funding;  Whereas, In order to provide an optimal and safe learning environment for students, the State of California has adopted and implemented standards for lighting, air quality, and noise levels on school campuses;Whereas, The Association of Physical Plant Administrators (APPA), an organization of educational facilities professionals, has created a five-tier measurement of facilities cleanliness, and Tier 1, the highest possible level, includes dust-free surfaces, adequate restroom supplies, empty trash containers and pencil sharpeners, among other criteria; andWhereas, In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with additional funding from the State and federal governments, the District has brought on temporary relief staff to support the safe return to in-person instruction; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District calls on the Governor and State Legislature to support our public schools in LAUSD and other school districts by providing increased, dedicated, and consistent funding to maintain the staffing levels necessary to keep campuses and worksites clean and safe according to the APPA Tier 1 standards; and, be it finally Resolved, That the Board supports the development of statewide custodial and staffing standards consistent with industry-wide practices like those proposed by the APPA, and that local educational agencies be fully funded to achieve those standards annually.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":6,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":1,"meeting_id":11,"meeting_date":"2021-05-18","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"ABSENT"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Health & Nutrition"]}}
