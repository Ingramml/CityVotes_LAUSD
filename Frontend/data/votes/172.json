Annually, the Local Plan’s Section D: Annual Budget Plan and Section E: Annual Service Plan must be completed, reviewed, and approved by the Local Education Agency (LEA) and submitted to the California Department of Education (CDE). Every three years, all sections (A-E) of the SELPA Local Plan must be revised. The last Board adoption of the annual SELPA Local Plan occurred in June 2024. \n \nSection A of the Local Plan “Contacts and Certifications” provides a description of the local planning process and governance structure used to ensure that special education services are delivered in compliance with state and federal laws. special education services.  \n \nSection B of the SELPA focuses on governance and administration. It outlines the organizational structure, responsibilities, and procedures for governing the SELPA and implementing special education services within the region. This section may include details about the SELPA's governing board, advisory committees, decision-making processes, budget allocations, and administrative procedures for managing programs and resources. It serves as a blueprint for how the SELPA operates and ensures accountability and transparency in its administration of special education services. \n \nThe Annual Budget Plan Section D projects special education revenues and expenditures. State (AB602) and Federal IDEA revenue projections are based on funding formulas that rely on student counts. The projected expenditure distribution is based on a districtwide analysis of all required Individualized Education Program (IEP) services, including low incidence and mental health services. \n \nThe Annual Services Plan Section E describes the services to be provided by the Local Education Agency (LEA). \n \nThe Community Advisory Committee (CAC) advised the policy and administrative agency during the development of the Local Plan, in accordance with California Education Code (EC) Section 56194. The Division of Special Education developed a Google Form to collect input from CAC members during the 30-day public review period, pursuant to California Education Code Sections 56194 (a) and (b); and 56205(a)(12)(E) and (b)(7).  \n \nThe proposed plan and the Notice of Public Hearing will be posted on the Division of Special Education website in the \"News & Announcements\" section at https://sped.lausd.org/ to promote public awareness.
