{"success":true,"vote":{"id":124,"item_number":"034-23/24","title":"Celebration of Play Day on June 29, 2024, and Promotion of Play Equity","description":"Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or District) Student ID is a unique identifier which allows the District to maintain, monitor and access every individual student’s school enrollment, demographics, parent/legal guardian/educational rights holder contact information, Individualized Education Plan (IEP) (if applicable), grades, transcripts, and other important pupil record information; Whereas, Because it is our responsibility to provide an education to every school-age person living within our boundaries in alignment with compulsory education obligations and since in practice students often move between District-authorized independent charter schools and traditional District public schools, all students in District-operated public schools and District authorized independent charter schools may be LAUSD students; and Whereas, Ensuring that all District-operated public school and District-authorized independent charter school students are included in the same Student ID system may create a seamless transition for families whose students move from District-authorized independent charter schools to LAUSD schools or from LAUSD schools to District-authorized independent charter schools, and may help support streamlining the process of having important records follow them throughout their time in LAUSD, regardless of the school they are enrolled in; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That all students in Los Angeles Unified School District, including those attending District-authorized independent charter schools, shall be assigned an LAUSD Student ID; Resolved further, That newly-assigned Student IDs pursuant to this Resolution will be utilized by the District in a manner consistent with independent charter schools’ current sharing of data through the established procedures and protocols; and, be it, finally Resolved, That Information Technology Services will develop a plan to initiate assigning an LAUSD Student ID to District-authorized independent charter school students during the 2024- 25 school year.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":48,"meeting_date":"2024-06-18","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Equity & Access","Resolutions & Recognitions"]}}
