The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $604,205,000.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nIn early January 2025, Los Angeles County experienced historic and catastrophic losses due to severe windstorms and multiple wildfires that devastated many cherished communities. For the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD, Los Angeles Unified, or the District), the Palisades Fire caused an unprecedented loss of facilities due to fire damage with significant impacts to Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School. The recommended scope, schedule, and budget for the design and reconstruction of these campuses has been developed to expedite the repopulation of the affected schools as a critical step in the recovery of the Pacific Palisades community.\n \nOn January 14, 2025, the Board of Education (Board) adopted a resolution declaring emergency conditions as a result of the severe windstorms and fire conditions (Emergency Conditions Resolution). This Board action also authorized the execution of emergency contracts through June 30, 2025, to address these emergency conditions and help ensure the continuation of public education, the health and safety of District students and staff, and the repair and restoration of District property. The Facilities Services Division created emergency projects in response to this resolution to begin preliminary site clearance and remediation at the three schools significantly impacted by the Palisades Fire.\n \nThe Campus Reconstruction Projects proposed in this action will restore and rebuild the Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School campuses. Marquez Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School includes two phases: Phase 1 provides interim facilities and site restoration to provide students with the opportunity to return to their campuses and Phase 2 provides permanent construction with new buildings and facilities for each campus, as detailed in Exhibit A. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed, as detailed in Exhibit A.  \n \nThe Campus Reconstruction Projects will be implemented under the School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - which was updated by Board actions in 2021 and 2024 to integrate Measures RR and US funds into categories of need that represent goals guiding project development. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School will be funded by the category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses while the proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School will be funded by the category of need for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions. Projects developed under both of these categories of need are included in the Facilities SEP. Although the Projects will be funded by local bonds, external funding sources are being sought as reimbursement to the Bond Program as well as to the emergency projects; these sources could include funding from insurance proceeds, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the State of California School Facilities Program.\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nStaff anticipates the Board will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to provide facilities that promote student health, safety, and educational quality.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and the campus reconstruction efforts will not move forward.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing new facilities that are urgently needed due to the devastating Palisades Fire.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $604,205,000. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School, with a combined budget of $337,584,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. The proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School, with a budget of $266,621,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.\n \nLAUSD is pursuing additional funding from numerous external sources including insurance claims, FEMA, and the State of California School Facilities Program. Staff does not yet know the amount or timing of receipt of funds from any of these potential sources, some of which may be available only as reimbursement. Depending on the timing, any external funding received for these projects would be used in lieu of, or as reimbursement to, bond funds. Even after receiving potential external funding, it is anticipated that some portion of funding from the Bond Program will be required to complete the proposed Projects. Additionally, any bond eligible costs that have been incurred on the emergency projects will be transferred to the Campus Reconstruction Projects.  \n \nEach Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.\n \nStudent Impact: \nApproval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to provide facilities that help ensure the approximately 3,620 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.\n \nEquity Impact:\nThese Projects replace facilities at Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School that were impacted by the Palisades Fire. Permanent facilities will be constructed to serve the student enrollment at each school prior to the Palisades Fire.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nLAUSD is committed to restoring these three school communities by providing facilities that allow for the expeditious repopulation of each campus. Initially, interim facilities will be placed to provide students with the opportunity to return to Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed. Thereafter, the District will design and construct permanent replacement facilities to fully restore the operations of each school.\n \nFacilities assessments, environmental remediation efforts, planning and design efforts, interim facilities procurement and installation, and other activities that were immediately necessary in response to the Palisades Fire are currently underway as part of the emergency projects created in response to the Emergency Conditions Resolution. The proposed Campus Reconstruction Projects will meet the District’s commitment to a prompt reopening of these schools.\n \nIt may be necessary to undertake additional feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedules, and budgets will be revised accordingly.\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Scope, Budget, and Schedule for Three Campus Reconstruction Projects \nExhibit B - BOC Resolution\nExhibit C - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n5/5/2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________                     \nALBERTO M.
