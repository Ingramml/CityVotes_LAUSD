The total combined budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Facilities Executive, Chief Procurement Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed SEEDS Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nThe SEEDS Program supports the development of projects that will enhance school sites by creating outdoor learning spaces in collaboration with school-based and community-led efforts (Program). There are two components to the Program:\n \n1.                     Development of the outdoor learning space constructed by Los Angeles Unified includes capital investments, such as asphalt removal, installation of irrigation and utilities, and any associated testing and inspection.\n \n2.                     Collaboration with a school site and/or partner organization that will outfit the outdoor learning space with the plant materials and landscaping features that align with the school’s instructional vision and program. This component is essential to the success of each project.\n \nPotential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school site by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit a SEEDS application to receive up to $100,000 to create or improve an outdoor learning space. An additional $50,000 is available to schools ranked in the top 150 on the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index of schools in need of green space as published in August 2022 (Greening Index).\n \nThe Greening Index ranks the five schools as follows: Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School (619), Mulholland Middle School (577), Stoner Avenue Elementary School (91), Toland Way Elementary School (336), and Warner Elementary School (144). Therefore, Stoner Avenue Elementary School and Warner Elementary School are eligible for the additional $50,000 allocation.\n \nDistrict staff evaluates the proposals based on the specific criteria and requirements outlined in the SEEDS Program Guide to ensure each proposal meets the eligibility requirements. Proposals must include a written project narrative describing the project scope, an explanation of how the project will be integrated into the school’s curriculum, and confirmation of the availability of resources to outfit and maintain the outdoor learning space. The recommended Projects included in this Board Report have been reviewed and have been found to comply with the program requirements, including feasibility and equitable distribution throughout the District.\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nApproval of this proposed action will enable staff to proceed with the design and construction of these five proposed Projects. Approval of these greening Projects will improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff, increase sustainability, and enhance the outdoor school environment.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nApproval of this proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to execute these proposed Projects that support educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science. If these proposed projects are not approved, the school sites will not benefit from the creation of these outdoor learning spaces.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe proposed action is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The action is also aligned with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 2 Joy and Wellness Welcoming Learning Environments by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe combined project budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000. The Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.\n \nThe combined project budget includes a contribution of $100,000 from Bond Program funds earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 4. This contribution will be transferred to funds earmarked in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency. The breakdown of this contribution by project is shown in Exhibit A.\n \nStudent Impact: \nThe proposed SEEDS projects at Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School, Mulholland Middle School, Stoner Avenue Elementary School, Toland Way Elementary School, and Warner Elementary School will provide outdoor learning spaces that create environments for student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. These SEEDS learning gardens will facilitate educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science, and may also be used during recess and lunchtime by approximately 2,510 current and future students. These proposed Projects also encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces.\n \nEquity Impact:\nPotential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit an application for a SEEDS project for up to $100,000. Schools ranked in the top 150 on the Greening Index will receive an additional $50,000 for their SEEDS project. Two of the five proposed projects included in this Board Report qualify for this additional funding.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nIn order to ensure the long-term permanence of each SEEDS project, the school site and/or its partner organization must enter into a Maintenance Agreement that provides for the ongoing maintenance of the proposed outdoor learning space.\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) Projects\nExhibit B - BOC Resolution\nExhibit C - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n05/05/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n_____________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
