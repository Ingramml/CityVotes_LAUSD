In addition, it requires that the members of the CAC be appointed by the Board of Education using selection procedures described in the SELPA Local Plan. CAC members serve a two-year term, which is staggered to ensure that no more than one half of the membership serves the first year of the term in any one year.\n \nThe CAC must be composed of the following: parents of individuals with exceptional needs enrolled in public or private schools (must serve as committee majority), parents of other students enrolled in school, students and adults with disabilities, regular education teachers, special education teachers, and other school personnel, representatives of other public and private agencies, and people concerned with the needs of individuals with exceptional needs. CAC bylaws also state that “CAC members must live, work, attend, or be the parent/guardian of a student attending a school within the LAUSD SELPA.”\n \nFor the last decade, prospective members of the CAC were identified through the ranking of applications, with an appointment committee assigning points to applications based on a rubric.  At parents' request last year for a more transparent process, the SELPA Local Plan language changed to allow for membership elections to occur in much the same way they transpire for other state-mandated District central committees identified in the California Education Code.  This year, vacancies for the seats of parents of students with exceptional needs were filled by in-person elections in each Region and online for the Virtual Academies.  The elections for special education students and special education teachers occurred online in the evening. The vacancies for the other categories of adult with disabilities, community members, community-based organizations, and alternate for the seat of parent of general education students were filled at an in-person election in a central location at the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement. \n \nVacancies for membership on the CAC were advertised on KLCS and District websites; through special education parent trainings and bi-weekly Family Academy webinars; through LAUSD’s Department of Transition Services (DOTS) staff and Region special education teams; and emails, voice, and text messages sent to all Los Angeles Unified families and additionally to parents or guardians of students with exceptional needs. Membership vacancies were also advertised via flyers and announcements during CAC, PAC, and DELAC meetings; at Region Ambassador sessions and various Region workshops; through the Charter Division and the Office of Development and Civic Engagement; and sent directly to each Board of Education staff via email for distribution. The Division of Special Education and the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement held 11 elections during April and one additional election in the month of May. The proposed persons being submitted for appointment to the CAC were elected by their peers, as required by the California Education Code. \n \nAccording to the California Education Code, Section 56194, the CAC addresses the responsibilities defined in the local plan as described below, including, but not limited to, all the following:\n \na.                     Advising the policy and administrative entity of the special education local plan area regarding\n the development, amendment, and review of the local plan. The entity shall  review and consider \n comments from the community advisory committee.\nb.                     Recommending annual priorities to be addressed by the plan.\nc.                     Assisting in parent education and in recruiting parents and other volunteers who may contribute\n to the implementation of the plan.\nd.                     Encouraging community involvement in the development and review of the local plan.\ne.                     Supporting activities on behalf of individuals with exceptional needs.\nf.                     Assisting in parent awareness of the importance of regular school attendance.\ng.                     Supporting community involvement in the parent advisory committee established pursuant to\n Section 52063 to encourage the inclusion of parents of individuals with exceptional needs to the \n extent these pupils also fall within one or more of the definitions in Section 42238.01”.\n \nThe Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement and the Division of Special Education are requesting a motion by the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education to appoint members to the CAC, a state-mandated committee established to advise the Board of Education and the Division of Special Education on the SELPA Local Plan.\n \nThe individuals in Attachment A were elected by their peers at an in-person or virtual election. They are recommended to be the new representatives of the CAC for a two-year term, or as alternates for a one-year term. \n \nExpected Outcomes:\nApproval by the Board of Education of those persons whose names have been submitted for CAC membership will enable the CAC to remain compliant within the guidelines established in the California Education Code, Sections 56190-56194.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nApproving the requested membership will enable the CAC to continue fulfilling the responsibilities as defined in the California Education Code, Section 56194, and in the SELPA Local Plan for service. If not approved, the District will be out of compliance with state requirements, and sanctions may be issued.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThis action supports the Board’s initiative to enhance parent engagement and is aligned to the Strategic Plan Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration. There are no changes to the existing policies of the District through this action.\n \nBudget Impact: \nNone\n \nStudent Impact:\nNone\n \nEquity Impact:\nNone\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nCalifornia Education Code, Sections 56190-56194, sets forth state requirements for the selection and appointment of members for the CAC. \n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - List of 2025-2027 two-year term candidates, 2025-2026 alternates, and members completing the last year of the 2024-2026 term on the Community Advisory Committee (CAC). \n \nSubmitted:\n05/05/25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
