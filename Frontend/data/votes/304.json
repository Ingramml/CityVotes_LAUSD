The budget for the proposed Project is $432,291.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nOn October 10, 2017, the Board of Education (Board) approved the Transition Plan under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements (Transition Plan). The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  \n \nA need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access buildings at the School has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student’s need for programmatic access. These types of projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed “rapidly” with a budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed Project does not meet the parameters of the RAP due to its scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the proposed Project to the Board for approval.\n \nThe School site spans 6.77 acres and is comprised of a traditional transitional kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school and a co-located charter school program. The building area is approximately 98,900 square feet and includes five multi-story permanent buildings, five single-story permanent buildings, and six relocatable buildings. The permanent buildings were constructed between 1926 and 2011. As of the 2025-2026 Electronic Capacity Assessment Report (E-CAR), the school serves approximately 477 students and currently 117 students have been identified as having a disability.\n \nThe site has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level. To meet the criteria for Category Two, upgrades to one building are required including the reconfiguration of the kiln room into an accessible restroom in the administration building, and any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2027.\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nDefine and approve the Project and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately implement the proposed Project.  \n \nIf the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the barrier removal project which is required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements.\n \nAny potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves.  This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. \n \nBudget Impact: \nThe total budget for the proposed Project is $432,291 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.\n \nThe budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.\nStudent Impact: \nThe proposed Project will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 440 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at this campus.\n \nEquity Impact:\nFacilities staff work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nBoth Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability.  As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities.  This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible.  While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities.  A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities.  This proposed Project is in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.\n \nThe School has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing a more robust scope that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that reconfiguring the kiln room in the administration building to provide an accessible restroom would provide students and staff direct access to the building. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.\n \nThe Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Student Eligibility by Program\nExhibit B - BOC Resolution\nExhibit C - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n11/17/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
