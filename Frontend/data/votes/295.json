The positions are either norm funded, funded by division of special education or purchased by the school site.\n \nStudent Impact:\nThe goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education teachers where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.\n \nEquity Impact:\nNot applicable\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nNot applicable\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - Teachers with Provisional Intern Permits\n \nSubmitted:\n12/10/25, Revision # 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
