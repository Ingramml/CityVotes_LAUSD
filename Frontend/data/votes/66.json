andWhereas, The District has monies from both federal and state government that are specifically directed at improving schools’ ability to address equity and climate in curricula, money that must be spent in 3 to 5 years;

and (iv) organization of a resource repository and its promotion through Schoology Climate Literacy groups, folders, and resources;Resolved further, That an existing staff member in at each school, be designated as a Climate Champion who will monitor how       climate literacy is built into language acquisition, English language arts, math, science, history/social studies, health, and other core subject areas; and, be it finallyResolved, That the District commits to support staff and to exploring future sources to fund positions in each Local District, Community of Schools, and every school to develop and implement the above programs","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":24,"meeting_date":"2022-02-08","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Curriculum & Instruction","Contracts & Agreements","Labor & Employment"]}}
