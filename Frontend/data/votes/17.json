{"success":true,"vote":{"id":17,"item_number":"012-20/21","title":"Celebration of Black History Month 2021","description":"Whereas, Black History Month, or National African American History Month, is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice, and as a result announced “Negro History Week” in 1925 to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans; Whereas, It is commonly stated that Carter G. Woodson selected February as the month to host “Negro History Week” because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history, namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, whose birthdays are February 12th and 14th respectively; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men; he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race, not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization;Whereas, Since 1976, the commemoration was extended from a week-long event to the entire month of February; Whereas, Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history; Whereas, The legacy of Carter G. Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), an organization now in its 105th Year; Whereas, The 2021 theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is “The Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity;”Whereas, The Black family has been a topic of study in many disciplines—history, literature, the visual arts and film studies, sociology, anthropology, and social policy thus making it a unifying theme for celebration in 2021; Whereas, While the role of the Black family has been described by some as a microcosm of the entire race, its complexity as the “foundation” of African American life and history can be seen in numerous debates over how to represent its meaning and typicality from a historical perspective—as enslaved or free, as patriarchal or matriarchal/matrifocal, as single-headed or dual-headed household, as extended or nuclear, as fictive kin or blood lineage, as legal or self- defined, and as Black or interracial, etc.;Whereas, The Black family offers a rich tapestry of images for exploring the African American past and present;Whereas, The representation, identity, and diversity of Black people have been reverenced, stereotyped, and vilified from the days of enslavement to our own time; Whereas, Black people continually remain optimistic and confident about the path ahead while leading the courageous, yet hard fought fights for the rights, liberties, and freedoms that many marginalized communities are now beneficiaries; andWhereas, Our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written, but Black Americans have continuously fought to make them true; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month;Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black Culture, Black Inventors, Black Artists, Black Artisans, Black Advocacy Black Leaders, and Black Civic Engagement; Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to convene a committee or working group to identify strategies and tactics to align resources targeted toward championing anti-racist educational practices and closing the gap of academic achievement outcomes for Black Students, and, be it finallyResolved, That the Superintendent will work with educators, librarians, all the schools of the District, and our wider community to recognize and celebrate this month with culturally relevant and appropriate curriculum, programs, ceremonies, and activities that generate in-depth discussion of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":6,"meeting_date":"2021-02-09","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Resolutions & Recognitions","Equity & Access"]}}
