Whereas, In response to the Genocide, the Near East Relief organization, the first Congressionally sanctioned American philanthropic effort created exclusively to rescue the Armenian Nation and other Christian minorities, was founded and provided unprecedented relief, delivering more than $117 million of humanitarian assistance between 1915 and 1930, and saving approximately one million refugees, including 130,000 orphans of the Genocide;Whereas, The Republic of Turkey has inexplicably and adamantly denied the occurrence of the crimes against humanity committed by the Ottoman and Young Turk rulers for many years, and continues to do so a full century since the first crimes constituting genocide occurred, despite the Turkish government’s earlier admissions and the overwhelming proof of genocidal intent;Whereas, The State of California has been at the forefront of encouraging and promoting a curriculum relating to human rights and genocide in order to empower future generations to prevent recurrence of genocide;Whereas, The Governor of California, in accordance with Assembly Concurrent Resolution 51, proclaimed April 24 of each year as a State Day of Remembrance in recognition of the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide;Whereas, The concern for human rights is a major element in the History-Social Science framework for California public schools, Kindergarten through 12th grade;Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District has been at the forefront of mandating that the Armenian Genocide not only be taught, but discussed and made a focal teaching point for universal religious and ethnic tolerance;Whereas, the District is committed to confronting difficult subjects, including the Armenian Genocide, in inclusive ways that ensure all students are respected and has strong nondiscrimination and anti-bullying policies to that end;  Whereas, Despite the significance of the Armenian Genocide both to the country and people of Armenia and to the history of the 20th century, teaching the history of the genocide with fidelity and cultural sensitivity often requires our educators to go deeper than our existing curricula provides;Whereas, On April 23, 2019, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District adopted Remembering and Honoring the Armenian Genocide of 1915 (Res-036-18/19), which sought to explore ways to recognize Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day and, as appropriate, other diverse cultural holidays recognized by our families, in school calendars set to go into effect in the 2021-2022 school year; Whereas, On October 16, 2020, the Board unanimously passed “Honoring the Significance of April 24th in the Los Angeles Unified School District” (Res-008-20/21), designating April 24th as an unassigned day on District school calendars beginning in the 2022-2023 school year to honor the Armenian Genocide, keep the school calendar consistent across the District, and address transportation, attendance, and staff challenges; Whereas, The District has a significant Armenian student population, many of whom have family members who experienced first-hand the horror and evil of the Armenian Genocide and the ongoing denial of the Armenian Genocide; now, therefore be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby commemorates April as the month of “Commemoration of the Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915” and April 24th as “Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day”; and, be it finallyResolved, That in doing so, the Board directs the Superintendent to seek to expand professional development opportunities to ensure that the Armenian Genocide is appropriately and meaningfully taught to students, staff, and the community at large, using inclusive, accessible materials that promote understanding and tolerance across cultures.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":6,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":1,"meeting_id":26,"meeting_date":"2022-04-05","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"ABSENT"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Resolutions & Recognitions","Curriculum & Instruction"]}}
