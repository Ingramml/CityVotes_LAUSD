In addition, authorize the submittal of the First Interim Financial Report to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).\n2.                     Adopt a Resolution authorizing the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund in Fiscal Year 2027-28 (enclosed herewith as “Attachment B”). \nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nUnder Education Code Sections 35035(i), 42130, and 42131, District staff must prepare and submit interim financial reports to the governing board at intervals throughout the fiscal year.  As part of the interim financial reports, the Board of Education (Board) certifies to the County Superintendent of Schools, the State Controller, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction whether the District is able to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the current fiscal year and the next two fiscal years, using one of three certification scenarios:\n \n•                     A positive certification indicates that based on current projections, the District will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and two subsequent years.\n•                     A qualified certification indicates that the District may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or two subsequent fiscal years.\n•                     A negative certification indicates that the District will not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nUpon approval by the Board, the District will file the First Interim Financial Report with the County Superintendent of Schools (CSS) and be in compliance with Education Code requirements.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nThe Board may accept the staff’s determination of a positive certification or approve the report with a modification of the revenue and expenditure projections.\n \nCSS shall review the District’s certification. It has the authority and responsibility to change the certification if it determines that the District’s certification was not appropriate.  \n \nIn the event the District’s certification is other than positive at the first interim period, it must submit a proposal to the CSS that addresses the District’s fiscal conditions (“fiscal recovery plan”).  In addition, it may not, in that fiscal year or the next fiscal year, issue non-voter approved debt unless the CSS determines that the District shall probably make repayment of such debt issuance. Moreover, the CSS may also impose various restrictions on districts that fail to deal with financial issues raised in interim reports. Finally, rating agencies may consider interim reports when evaluating or revising credit ratings.\n \nThe Board may elect not to authorize the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund Other Than for Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund, thereby requiring other balancing solutions to maintain positive balances in the multi-year projection period.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nBoard approval and submission of the District’s 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and ensures compliance with the Education Code and LACOE requirements. Furthermore, the authorization and balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund shall improve the District’s financial condition.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThis report maintains reserves at the required statutory level.\n \nStudent Impact:\nCompliance with Education Code requirements ensures that the District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.\n \nEquity Impact:\n\n\n\nComponent\n\nScore\n\nScore Rationale\n\n\n\nRecognition\n\n3\n\nDistrict budgeting ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities”.  While some allocations of resources are district-wide, some investments such as Student Equity Need Index recognize historical inequities.\n\n\n\nResource Prioritization\n\n3\n\nResource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.\n\n\n\nResults\n\n3\n\nResources are allocated to the extent that it would support student needs, address priorities of achieving the District’s Strategic Plan.  \n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n9\n\n \n\n\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nNone.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and Multi-Year Projections \nAttachment B - Board Resolution Authorizing the Balance Transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund in a Future Fiscal Year\n \nSubmitted:\n12/05/25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
