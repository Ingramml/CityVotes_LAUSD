Recommends approval of an amendment to the Information Technology Services (ITS) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to authorize the definition, funding allocation, and related actions necessary to implement the School Network Alternative Connectivity Pilot project, as detailed in Attachments A-D.  The project budget is $10,639,200 and is funded by bond funds (100%). It is anticipated to be completed by June 2027. \nend\n \nRecommendation\nAction Proposed: \nApprove an amendment to the ITS SEP to authorize the definition, funding allocation, and related actions necessary to implement the School Network Alternative Connectivity Pilot project, as detailed in Attachments A, B, C, and D. \n \nThe proposed actions are as follows: \n•                     Redirect and allocate $10,639,200 in bond-funded cost savings from in-progress projects to fully fund the School Network Alternative Connectivity Pilot project.\n•                     Authorize execution of the School Network Alternative Connectivity Pilot project, including all required planning, procurement, implementation, and administrative actions.\n \nThe project budget is $10,639,200 and is funded by bond funds (100%). It is anticipated to be completed by June 2027.  \n \nThis project will pilot a dark fiber ring - a network system that interconnects school networks to each other using fiber optic cabling across 44 school sites to provide redundant, high-availability connectivity and evaluate the feasibility, performance, and scalability of this alternative connectivity model to determine its potential for District-wide implementation. \nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nOn August 24, 2024, the Board of Education approved the update of the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure US funding and priorities (Board Rpt. 029-24/25), the next phase of the District's Bond Program, which will modernize, build, and repair school facilities to improve student health, safety and educational quality.  The Board's action approved the overarching goals and principles, funding sources, specific categories of need, and spending targets for the SUP.  As proposed projects are developed, they are submitted to the Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) for consideration and the Board of Education for approval.    \n  \nThe SUP includes spending targets to address “Technology Infrastructure & System Upgrades.” The proposed project aligns with this SUP category. \n  \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:    \nThe School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC), at its December 11, 2025, meeting, considered this item.  Staff have concluded that this proposed SEP Amendment will facilitate the implementation of the ITS SEP, and therefore it will not adversely affect the District’s ability to successfully complete the ITS SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nStaff anticipate that the Board will amend the ITS SEP to define the new project described herein and allocate $10,639,200 of Bond Program funding. This project will enable the District to provide redundant, high-availability connectivity across 44 selected school sites and determine how this resilient, cost-effective technology can enhance network redundancy and maintain continuous service in support of teaching, learning, and campus safety.  \n   \nFurthermore, this project directly contributes to achievement of several pillars and priorities of the 2022-2026 LAUSD Strategic Plan, including: High-Quality Instruction, College and Career Readiness, and Eliminating Opportunity Gaps (Pillar 1: Academic Excellence); Welcoming Learning Environments (Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness); and Modernize Infrastructure (Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness). \n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nFailure or delay of approval will postpone the execution and/or implementation of the proposed project and the associated benefits to the schools and students.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThis action is consistent with the District’s long-term goal to address unmet school needs as described in Proposition BB and Measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe proposed project has a total budget of $10,639,200, all of which will come from Bond Program funding. The bond funds will be allocated from the “Technology Infrastructure & System Upgrades” SUP category of need.   \n   \nUpon completion of the project, $220,974 in new funds will be needed annually to maintain the new systems deployed.  These costs are anticipated to be paid from the Division’s existing budget.  \n \nStudent Impact:\nThe proposed project has the following outcomes and benefits that impact students:   \n•                     Backup Connectivity - Maintains critical operations during primary WAN outages.    \n•                     Future-Ready Technology - Introduces scalable, next-generation solutions aligned with long-term goals.    \n•                     Reduced Downtime - Minimizes instructional and administrative disruptions from network outages.\n•                     Pilot for Expansion - Provides a model to guide District-wide deployment of resilient, cost-effective connectivity.   \n \nEquity Impact:\n\n\n\n Component\n\n    Score \n\n Score Rationale\n\n\n\nRecognition\n\n       4\n\nThe pilot of alternative network connectivity provides improved and equal access to a safe learning environment for students at 44 school sites.       The 44 school sites of the pilot were identified and prioritized to participate in the pilot based on an analysis of historical outages caused by cable theft and fiber cuts and the potential of this area receiving the most benefit from introduction of a dark fiber ring.    \n\n\n\nResource Prioritization\n\n       4\n\nThe pilot of alternative network connectivity provides improved and equal access to resources for students at 44 school sites by addressing vulnerabilities caused by the lack of backup network connectivity.  \n\n\n\nResults\n\n       4\n\nThis project directly contributes to achievement of several pillars and priorities of the 2022-2026 LAUSD Strategic Plan, including: High-Quality Instruction, College and Career Readiness, and Eliminating Opportunity gaps (Pillar 1: Academic Excellence); Welcoming Learning Environments (Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness); and Modernize Infrastructure (Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness).    \n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n      12\n\n \n\n\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nThe School Network Alternative Connectivity Pilot project introduces a dark fiber ring network system, at 44 school sites, interconnects school networks to each other using fiber optic cabling to provide seamless, uninterrupted network connectivity across campuses, and evaluates the feasibility of expanding the technology District-wide. In the absence of this pilot, District schools will continue using traditional networks that rely on a single WAN connection, which can create a single point of failure that disrupts instruction, daily operations, and safety.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - Project Definition    \nAttachment B - Bond Oversight Committee Resolution    \nAttachment C - Presentation Slide Deck   \nAttachment D - List of Sites   \n \nSubmitted:\n12/02/25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
