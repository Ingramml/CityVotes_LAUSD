The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a state mandated three-year plan that is updated each year and describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures of Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. Every year, the 51 Affiliated Charter Schools develop and update their LCAPs.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nBased on the state Education Code, each Affiliated Charter School is its own local education agency, so each must complete a separate written LCAP. These LCAPS must be adopted at the same meeting at which the Board of Education adopts the budget for 2025-2026. The 2025-26 LCAP is the first year of the three year cycle for 2024-27 and provides available Baseline and Year 1 Outcomes for LCAP metrics and includes annual updates on the implementation of LCAP actions in 2024-25. The LCAPs also include separate Action Tables in addition to the Budget Overviews for Parents. These materials must all be combined and posted on each Affiliated Charter School's website.\n \nAs part of the District’s support for our 51 Affiliated Charter Schools, the District LCAP team supports the development of these LCAPs by providing budgetary and metric data along with working with Affiliated Charter Schools to share specific school LCAP information to communicate the progress at their school sites. Affiliated Charter Schools are supported by the LCAP team through ongoing training, guidance and direct support that spans year-round, which includes hybrid office hours, work group sessions and one-on-one consultations to ensure compliance and alignment to the District LCAP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nApproval of these LCAPs will allow District Affiliated Charter Schools to meet the state-mandated requirement.\n \n \n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nA “Yes” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.\n \nA “No” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools not meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThis action does not change District policies.\n \nBudget Impact: \nApproval of these Affiliated Charter Schools’ LCAPs is necessary to approve their budgets. Existing staff and resources will support posting the LCAP to the District and Affiliated Charter Schools’ websites.\n \nStudent Impact:\nThis proposed action shares the affiliated charters' engagement, planning and budgeting to meet student needs in 2025-26.\n \nEquity Impact:\n \n\n\n\nComponent\n\n  Score\n\nScore Rationale\n\n\n\nRecognition\n\n      4\n\nThe Affiliated Charter School LCAPs describe how the District’s Affiliated Charters will leverage both District funds and school discretionary funds to implement programs and policies to support all students, as well as how these schools will increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low-income students. The Affiliated Charter School LCAPs are aligned to the 2022 -26 Strategic Plan Pillars: Academic Excellence, Joy and Wellness, Engagement and Collaboration, Operational Effectiveness, and Investing in Staff.\n\n\n\nResource Prioritization\n\n     4\n\nAs stated above, the Affiliated Charter School LCAPs describe how the Affiliated Charter Schools will allocate resources in 2025-26 to support the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) target student populations: low-income students, English Learners, and students in foster care.\n\n\n\nResults\n\n     4\n\nThe Affiliated Charter School LCAPs allocate and annually monitor the use of funds to meet student needs and close equity gaps to improve student equity across all student groups by eliminating opportunity gaps and increasing student achievement.\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n    12\n\n \n\n\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nThe Affiliated Charter School LCAPs describe the implementation of programs and policies to support all students in the LCFF state priority areas, as well as how the District will leverage supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low- income students. The Affiliated Charter School LCAPs are aligned to reflect 2022-26 Strategic Plan Pillars, strategies, and priorities.\n \nThe Affiliated Charter Schools LCAPs include all state LCFF funds and Equity Multiplier Funds for Equity Multiplier eligible schools, but does not reflect any other local, state, and federal sources of funding. The 2025 Affiliated Charter Schools LCAPs also address a requirement first implemented through state mandate in 2023 to calculate and report carryover of unspent supplemental and concentration funds to support future increased or improved services. This carryover calculation only reflects funds that are under school discretion and which carry over within these schools’ budgets.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - Affiliated Charter LCAPs Link: \n  https://tinyurl.com/2025-ACS-LCAP-Board-Materials\nAttachment B - State Accountability Dashboard Local Indicators for Affiliated Charters Link:\n  <https://tinyurl.com/ACS-2025-Local-Indicators>\n \nSubmitted:\n05/19/25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
