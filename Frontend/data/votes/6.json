{"success":true,"vote":{"id":6,"item_number":"029-19/20","title":"Recognizing and Reaffirming Los Angeles Unified School District’s Commitment to Serving Students with Moderate-to-Severe Disabilities","description":"Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over 84,000 students receiving special education services;Whereas, The number and percentage of students with moderate to severe disabilities served by the District has steadily increased each year, with the District serving over 24,000 students with moderate to severe disabilities in the 2018-19 school year, an 11 percent increase from 2002-03;Whereas, The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 (IDEA) by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states, local school districts, and taxpayers to pay for needed services, and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall, ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from;Whereas, In the 2018-19 school year the District spent over $1.7 billion in special education costs, with federal IDEA funding only reaching $108 million, accounting for just 6 percent of the District’s expenditures, woefully short of Congress’ commitment upon IDEA’s passage to 40 percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities;Whereas, According to the California Legislative Analyst's Office, local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures, 61 percent in 2017-18 as compared to 49 percent in 2007-08, with an estimated two-thirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities (November 2019);Whereas, The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the student’s disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities;Whereas, The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance (AB 602) providing Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) funding based on their overall student attendance, regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide; andWhereas, The District proudly operates 13 Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets eachindividual student’s unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with moderate to severe disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with moderate to severe disabilities;Resolved further, That the District formally recognizes December 2nd as Annual Special Education Day and encourages all schools and students to celebrate the diversity of their peers with disabilities;Resolved further, That the Board commits to continued advocacy for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the instructional programs and services for our students with moderate-to-severe disabilities, such as increasing California’s funding allocations to meet the increases in special education costs, particularly for students with moderate to severe disabilities, Congress passing the IDEA Full Funding Act (H.R. 1878) and Funding Early Childhood is the Right IDEA Act (H.R. 4107);Resolved further, That the Superintendent is directed to develop an advocacy strategy, at both the state and federal level, that is inclusive of families and educators of students with disabilities in order to improve the statewide special education system as well as push for sustained resources required to operate the District’s special education programs; and, be it finallyResolved, That the Superintendent is directed to develop more regular opportunities for parents and families of Students with moderate-to-severe disabilities to engage with the District to provide meaningful feedback, opportunities for continuous improvement and strengthen partnerships and resources.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":2,"meeting_date":"2020-02-04","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":11,"full_name":"Richard Vladovic","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Budget & Finance","Equity & Access","Governance & Policy"]}}
