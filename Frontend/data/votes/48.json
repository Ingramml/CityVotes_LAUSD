Survey results showed a broad range of opinions about what public safety measures respondents preferred or made them feel most comfortable including key findings that, across the demographic subgroups surveyed, perceptions of the Los Angeles School Police Department were largely positive, and among parents and staff there was significant opposition to reducing the presence of school police;Whereas, Attitudes toward school policing are likely viewed through the lens of perceived levels of campus safety and perceptions of school police, including the following:·\tThe broadly held view that campuses are generally safe before, during, and afterschool;·\tHigh degrees of consensus that school police are engaged in emergency response activities and protecting campus perimeters, but less certainty around other areas of engagement; and·\tLess familiarity with segments of the community that may be negatively impacted by school policing;Whereas, In the 2019-20 school year, out of 115,000 services calls, there were only 10 total complaints against school police from staff, parents or students;Whereas, Each school site is responsible for developing a comprehensive safety plan based on the needs of the campus climate, which is reflective in the cornerstone value of the Community Schools model of local autonomy and decision making, yet school-based administrators have expressed profound unreadiness and a lack of empowerment as it relates to accessing all available resources to aid in optimizing school safety for their campuses in a way that aligns with the true spirit of local control; andWhereas, The Board and District staff - understanding that the District covers an area totaling 710 square miles, including most of the city of Los Angeles and all or portions of 26 cities and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County - are currently engaged in profound discussions about the need for equitable resource allocation based on the recognition that school communities have different needs based on unequal and different opportunities, resources and experiences; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the students, parents and staff who constitute the different and diverse school communities throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District be granted the authority and flexibility to discuss, determine and decide on the measures they believe will improve and maintain positive school climate and safety on their school campuses; and be it finally Resolved, That the Superintendent direct staff to implement the School Police Request Assessment process developed by the Office of School Climate and Culture or develop a new safety assessment plan to be completed within 30 days.","outcome":"FAIL","ayes":2,"noes":4,"abstain":1,"absent":0,"meeting_id":17,"meeting_date":"2021-09-14","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"ABSTAIN"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"NAY"}],"topics":["Facilities & Construction","Contracts & Agreements","Labor & Employment"]}}
