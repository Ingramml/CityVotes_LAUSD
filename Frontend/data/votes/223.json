The current project budget is $177,555,145. 2) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments to implement the proposed Project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.   3) Adopt the Office of Environmental Health and Safety's (OEHS) evaluation of the proposed Project which resulted in the preparation of a ND. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, and to permit construction activities to commence, this proposed action may only be considered after the Board adopts the ND prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project (Board Report No. 041-25/26). endBodyBackground: On October 12, 2021, the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified) Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary at Fairfax High School (School or Campus) for a major modernization project. Subsequently, on June 13, 2023 the Board approved the redefinition of the Project to include the full scope, schedule, and budget to complete the Project, and on January 14, 2025 approved the Design-Build Contract Award to Pinner Construction Co., Inc. in partnership with DLR Group Inc. with a contract value of $142,998,000. Fairfax High School is located on a 23.63-acre school campus at 7850 Melrose Avenue within the City of Los Angeles (Board District 4, Region West). The School originally opened in 1924. All existing buildings were constructed between 1923 and 2011. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the school served approximately 1,500 students in grades 9 through 12.   The proposed Project includes the construction of a new gymnasium, five specialty classrooms, outdoor physical education courts, and maintenance and operations (M&O) facilities. The new two-story gymnasium building includes team rooms and locker rooms; a public entrance and lobby providing access to the building from the west parking area along Fairfax Avenue; and five new classrooms that will host Ceramics, Drama, Instrumental Music, Sports Medicine, and Dance classes. The outdoor physical education courts will be comprised of basketball/volleyball courts, adjacent areas with trees and seating. Demolition activities will include the removal of the Shop Building, Gymnasium, M&O Building, Ticket Office, and Relocatable Sanitary Building, including foundations and below-grade and above-grade utility infrastructure associated with these buildings and structures. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impacts during construction.Additional improvements encompass exterior painting of all remaining buildings to provide a uniform appearance; associated landscape, hardscape, parking improvements, and related infrastructure upgrades including a new electrical transformer.Expected Outcomes:Approval of the proposed Project will permit construction activities to be undertaken once the Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval is secured. Construction activities are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2026 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 2029.  Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of staff's proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured. If the proposed action is not adopted, staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities. As a result, the School will continue to operate with aging, deteriorating, and outdated buildings and grounds. Furthermore, students, staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project.Policy Implications: This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.Budget Impact: The proposed action does not have a budget impact as the Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it approved the Project definition and authorized the design-build contract award. The current budget for the proposed Project is $177,555,145. The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.   Student Impact: The proposed Project will help ensure that approximately 1,500 existing and future students attending the School are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.Equity Impact:The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified's reliance on relocatable buildings, and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the proposed Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows Los Angeles Unified to reach more schools with the limited funding available.Issues and Analysis: OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of the ND. The ND was circulated for a 30-day public review period from May 7, 2025, to June 6, 2025. The analysis documented in the IS/ND found that the proposed Project would not result in significant environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction, the Board must adopt the ND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project.   In 2016, the Board authorized a proposal by Arts Fairfax to donate a new 3,300 square foot art gallery and classroom building (Gallery Building) at the School, consisting of an exhibition/classroom space, office space, conference room, storage, and restrooms. Additionally, the Board authorized the inclusion of the Gallery Building design in the construction bid documents for the Project as an add alternate. The Gallery Building scope of work was included as part of the CEQA analysis for potential environmental impacts and as referenced in the CEQA documents (IS/ND). Construction of the Gallery Building will only proceed if additional funding becomes available through future external and/or District sources.Attachments:NoneSubmitted:08/26/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\t\t\tAPPROVED BY:______________________________\t\t\t_____________________________ALBERTO M.
