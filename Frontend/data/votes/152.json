The budget for the proposed project is $8,544,763.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nThe Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled \"Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions.\" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. \n \nThe proposed Project will create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classroom may include learning stations with the following components:\n \n•                     Music and movement\n•                     Climbing and balance\n•                     Messy materials\n•                     Nature art\n•                     Water play\n•                     Sand play\n•                     Garden\n•                     Dirt digging\n•                     Building materials\n \nThe proposed Project will provide an outdoor classroom by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. Campus upgrades include new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, roofing, irrigation system, exterior painting of the Children’s Center Building, necessary upgrades to the fire alarm system and utilities, and interim facilities to support school programs during construction. Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility upgrades include accessible path of travel, parking area, doors and signage, and a children’s restroom. The scope of work also includes any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state, and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2028.\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nStaff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. \n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Project. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, access to nature-based green space will remain limited, and early education facilities needs will remain unaddressed.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThis action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe total budget for the Project is $8,544,763 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.\n \nThe Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the Project.\n \nStudent Impact: \nThe proposed Project will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning, as well as address early education facilities needs that are necessary to improve student health, safety, and educational quality to benefit approximately 115 students at Lemay Street Early Education Center (Board District 3, Region North).\n \nExpected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor spaces will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.\n \nEquity Impact:\nThe proposed Project was identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with the Region and school site administrator. The site was selected based upon the center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.\n \nIssues and Analysis:\nStaff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. \n \nThe Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Project’s proposal in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Project’s scope will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Project’s scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - BOC Resolution\nExhibit B - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n03/11/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
