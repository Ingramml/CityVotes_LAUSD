The Team serves to provides guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property, and the environment.  \n \nFrom time to time, vacancies occur, and these vacancies must be filled by approval of proposed individuals by the Board.  The prospective members are proposed by the IPM team itself, or comes from one of the constituencies as defined by the original Policy. \n \nThe current vacancies needing to be filled are (1) a public health representative, (2) a District non-management representative from Maintenance and Operations, and (3) a representative from LAUSD Office of Environmental Health and Safety. \n \nExpected Outcomes:\nApproval of the three proposed members to fill existing vacancies in order to provide for a full Team as directed by the IPM Policy.  The Team and all members will operate consistent with the terms of the Policy.  \n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nFailure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges. Quorum will be a challenge to meet, and constituencies required by the Policy will remain unrepresented. \n \nPolicy Implications: \nPositive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.  \n \nBudget Impact: \nNot Applicable.\n \nStudent Impact:\nNot Applicable.\n \nEquity Impact:\nNot Applicable.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nNot Applicable.\n \nAttachments:\nA.                     List of individuals to fill existing vacancies, with brief biographies. \nB.                     Ethics forms \n \nSubmitted:\n11/07/25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                     \nMICHAEL A.
