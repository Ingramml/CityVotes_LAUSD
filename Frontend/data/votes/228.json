\n \nWhereas, The current political climate has seen an unprecedented and often violent increase in anti-immigrant enforcement actions, policy proposals, and rhetoric that directly impact Latino students, families, and communities, creating fear and barriers to full participation in public education; and\n \nWhereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District remains committed to its status as a sanctuary district, implementing policies and practices that protect immigrant students and families from discrimination, harassment, and enforcement actions on school grounds in addition to providing resources and direct support for those impacted; now, therefore, be it\n \nResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes and celebrates September 15 through October 15 as Latino Heritage Month; \n \nResolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will work to promote educational resources on Latine history, culture, and heritage and make them widely available to staff, students, and families online through the Los Angeles Unified School District homepage and social media accounts; \n \nResolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to fully implement and protect Ethnic Studies curriculum that reflects the histories, struggles, and contributions of Latine communities, recognizing it as a critical component of a well-rounded education for all students; \n \nResolved further, That the Board affirms that, given the large percentage  of Latine students in LAUSD, Latine history, experiences, and contributions should be integrated and embedded in all areas of the curricula and at all ages, not just during Latine Heritage Month or in Ethnic Studies, and that the District should, therefore, strive to support educators to do so; \n \nResolved further, That the Board recognizes the importance of Spanish language instruction as both a core academic subject and a cultural bridge for our diverse communities, and commits to protecting and expanding high-quality, culturally affirming Spanish language programs amid current pressures and threats to bilingual education, as well as continued efforts to foster the inclusion of and improve supports for students and families who are primarily speakers of indigenous languages; \n \nResolved further, That in light of the current political climate and the heightened attacks on Latine and all immigrant students and families, the Board reaffirms its status as a sanctuary district, its unwavering dedication to ensuring that LAUSD remains a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment for every student, regardless of cultural background or immigration status, and to continue advancing policies and practices that protect their rights, dignity, and educational opportunities; \n \nResolved further, That the Board further reaffirms the need for integrating trauma-informed practices in the curricula and providing mental health support and programs at school sites to support students and their families;\n \nResolved further, That the District acknowledges that ongoing investments in and implementation of LGBTQ+ supports, the Black Student Achievement Plan, and Student Success Centers will impact our Latine students in a positive and powerful way;\n \nResolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will monitor and update the Board on impacts to learning, student and staff attendance, well-being and school climate, and family engagement that may result from current and future federal actions and identify ways LAUSD can mitigate any barriers, provide additional supports,  and ensure all students receive their constitutional rights to a public education; and, be it finally\n \nResolved, That by adoption of this resolution, the Board and Superintendent hereby encourage all students, staff, and families, to commemorate and celebrate the immense historical and cultural contributions that Latine people have made and continue to make here in Los Angeles, California, and the United States particularly in light of the targeted assaults this community faces today.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":63,"meeting_date":"2025-09-16","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":5,"full_name":"Karla Griego","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":8,"full_name":"Sherlett H.
