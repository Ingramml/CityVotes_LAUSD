\n \nWhereas, National Mentoring Month recognizes the invaluable contributions of mentors and raises awareness of how positive mentoring relationships strengthen students, families, schools, and communities; \n \nWhereas, Mentoring fosters positive life and social skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achievement and college access, supports career exploration, and nurtures youth leadership development;\n \nWhereas, Research shows that youth with mentors are 92 percent more likely to volunteer regularly in their communities, 75 percent more likely to hold leadership positions in clubs or sports teams, 22 percent more likely to feel a strong sense of belonging during their upbringing, and 58 percent credit their mentor with supporting their mental health; \n \nWhereas, Mentoring demonstrates long-term effectiveness, with 74 percent of individuals who had a meaningful mentor reporting that their mentor significantly contributed to later life success, 85 percent saying their mentor helped them with school-related challenges, and nearly 60 percent of individuals under 40 continuing to draw advice from their childhood mentors; \n \nWhereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes mentoring as a powerful tool for promoting educational equity, fostering resilience, closing opportunity gaps, and supporting the social and emotional well-being of all students; \n \nWhereas, The Beyond the Bell program provides enriching before- and after-school opportunities where students receive academic guidance, leadership development, and supportive relationships that often grow into meaningful mentoring connections; \n \nWhereas, Linked Learning pathways integrate rigorous academics with real-world experiences and mentorship from industry professionals in sectors such as engineering, healthcare, computer science, and the arts, preparing students for college, careers, and civic engagement; \n \nWhereas, GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) offers long-term, cohort-based mentoring and college readiness support for middle and high school students, helping them navigate academic challenges, build confidence, and prepare for postsecondary success; \nWhereas, The Foster Youth Achievement Program provides specialized support, advocacy, and mentorship to students in foster care, ensuring they receive the individualized guidance and stability needed to overcome systemic barriers and thrive academically and emotionally; \n \nWhereas, Federal budget proposals for fiscal year 2026 would eliminate funding for GEAR UP, among other student aid and mentoring/college-access programs;\n \nWhereas, The District recognizes that reductions in federal funding for mentoring and access programs would disproportionately affect students who benefit most from those services and undermine long-term equity and opportunity goals; and\n \nWhereas, The District maintains strong partnerships with universities, nonprofit organizations, community-based agencies, and civic groups to expand mentoring opportunities across the District and ensure that all students have access to trusted, supportive role models; now, therefore, be it\n \nResolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes January 2026 as National Mentoring Month and encourages students, families, employees, community members, and partner organizations to participate in mentoring activities that empower youth and strengthen communities; \n \nResolved further, That the District strongly advocates for the continued funding and expansion of mentoring and college-access programs, and urges federal, state, and local policymakers to ensure that these critical supports remain available to students in need; and, be it finally\n \nResolved, That the District reaffirms its commitment to expanding, supporting, and promoting mentoring programs, partnerships, and opportunities that help young people realize their full potential and graduate ready for the world.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":1,"meeting_id":66,"meeting_date":"2025-12-16","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":12,"full_name":"Jerry Yang","vote_choice":"ABSENT"},{"member_id":5,"full_name":"Karla Griego","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":8,"full_name":"Sherlett H.
