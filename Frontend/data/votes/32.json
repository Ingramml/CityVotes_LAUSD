Bel Air has a case rate of 3,963 per 100,000 residents, while Boyle Heights has a case rate of 18,764 per 100,000 residents;Whereas, Low-income families of color continue to disproportionately bear the brunt of the pandemic. Data from Los Angeles County shows COVID-19 deaths among Latinx residents increased over 1,000 percent between November 2020 January 2021. Life expectancy of Black and Latinx populations have declined by 2.7 and 1.9 years, respectively, compared to .8 years for the Anglo population;Whereas, Financial losses experienced by families in highest-need communities have resulted in some students taking additional responsibilities at home, including care-taker roles, teaching of younger siblings, and seeking out employment to contribute to the family’s basic needs;Whereas, Students in highest-need communities have expressed increased wellness needs to cope with factors such as additional responsibilities, grief due to loss of life from COVID-19, and a surge of gun violence in South L.A.;Whereas, The District has looked at these inequities in the past and has developed the Student Equity Needs Index (SENI) in order to assess and accurately identify schools that need the most support, allowing the District to differentiate investments and supports based on each school’s level of need;Whereas, Communities with Highest- and High-Need schools as identified by the SENI are experiencing an unprecedented crisis, evidenced by the death or illness of thousands and disproportionate economic impacts, including education, income, and housing as a result of COVID-19 and the digital divide;Whereas, Prior to this crisis, the District allocated $284 million to schools in 2020-21 through the SENI funding formula;Whereas, Increased education investments are associated with improved student outcomes;Whereas, Successful advocacy by the District and various community partners for additional state and federal funding to mitigate the significant impacts of COVID-19 will result in approximately $5 billion of projected additional state and federal funding being allocated to the District;Whereas, A significant portion of the District’s supplemental and concentration dollars are currently allocated to District-wide programs rather than school-based allocations;Whereas, Through an equity-based funding formula that uses a school’s rank on the SENI, the District can use new and existing funds to double a school’s funding, resulting in average increases in funding for the Highest- and High-need schools of approximately $850,000 for high schools, $720,000 for middle schools, and $300,000 for elementary schools;Whereas, This increase in funding would allow the Highest- and High-Need schools to reduce class sizes as well as invest in new counselors, psychiatric social workers, instructional coaches, and other intervention positions;Whereas, An increased investment in the SENI will ensure new and existing dollars intended to remediate the impact of COVID-19 and learning loss are distributed to schools proportionate to their needs; andWhereas, The District has already committed an additional $120 million ($404 million in total) to the SENI equity-based funding formula for the 2021-22 school year; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports the Community of Schools strategy to empower school leaders and leverage a community approach to accelerates progress in student outcomes;Resolved further, That the District will utilize an equity-based funding formula that uses a school’s rank on SENI and incorporates COVID-19 impact to allocate a minimum of $700 million, which will grow every year, of supplemental and concentration funding (an additional $298 million dollars over the proposed 2021-22 budget) to be known collectively as “SENI Funding”, and that a portion of the additional funding will allow per pupil SENI funding for elementary students to rise to a level commensurate with SENI funding levels for secondary students;Resolved further, That this additional SENI Funding shall be in addition to, rather than replace any existing equity-based spending or programs that currently benefit schools;Resolved further, That the funds previously reserved as “hold harmless” to allow for a stable transition to the current SENI formula will go towards the increase in the SENI funding, excepting that options schools will not receive reduced funding as a result of this resolution until such time as an alternative funding plan for option schools is developed; Resolved further, That the District commits to an equitable distribution of COVID-19 relief funds and other intervention funding, determined by COVID’s impact on the community, SENI, and other factors;Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall prioritize the allocation of funds be directly to schools based on identified student needs and provide the Board with an accounting of how increased funding is allocated to schools across the District as part of the annual budgeting process;Resolved further, That the District shall ensure full transparency regarding the SENI formula and any new student-centered funding formulas, and the development of those formulas, that includes providing the following data in a downloadable Excel spreadsheet format available to the public:•\tThe pupil count, percentage count, and other rates of factors for every need indicator in the Student Equity Needs Index for each individual school in the District;•\tThe calculations based upon each of those need indicators for each school that goes into determining the SENI Score for that school;•\tThe calculations that aggregate those need indicators for each individual school;•\tThe methodology and calculations used based upon this data to determine the per- pupil allocation to each school;·Resolved further, That at the end of each school fiscal year the District shall provide a public accounting for every school in the District of how much SENI money was actually received and how it was spent.Resolved further, That the Superintendent will convene a task force to gather meaningful community input to inform the development of a support and evaluation plan for student outcomes as a result of SENI investments. The plan should be presented to the Board and public by June 2022. The plan should identify 1) how the District will measure the impact of SENI funding on student outcomes, 2) what support and assistance will be provided to school sites receiving funding to facilitate the effective and equitable use of SENI funding, and 3) what additional and targeted budgeting support will be implemented for schools, communities of schools, or local districts that do not improve student outcomes starting in 2022-23.  Updates shall be provided to the Board and the public on a periodic basis, not less than annually; and, be it finally Resolved, That the ongoing Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) cycle will incorporate the above resolutions as part of the forthcoming LCAP.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":6,"noes":1,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":10,"meeting_date":"2021-05-11","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Health & Nutrition","Equity & Access"]}}
