Doe, 1984);  Whereas, Due to the actions of the federal government under the Trump Administration, nearly 70,000 migrant children were held in government custody in 2019, an increase of 42 percent compared to the previous year (Associated Press, 2019); Whereas, The median length of detention for children is 154 days, more than five months, and some children have been in detention as long as a year; and children have systematically been separated from their families, causing potential long-lasting detrimental effects, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (March 2017); Whereas, The United States is the only country in the United Nations body to have not ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child (September 1990), and The United Nations Human Rights Office reported that the Trump administration’s current “zero tolerance” practice of family separation “amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life, and is a serious violation of the rights of the child” (June 2018); Whereas, VisionQuest, a for-profit private corporation with a history of allegations of mistreatment of detained children dating back to the 1980s (Newsweek, November 2019), has petitioned the City of Los Angeles to approve the development of a facility in Arleta in the East San Fernando Valley to house detained unaccompanied minors facing immigration proceedings; andWhereas, The detention of migrant children has no place in the communities of Los Angeles; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District categorically opposes VisionQuest’s proposal to open and operate a migrant youth detention center in Arleta, as well as any other immigrant youth detention center within the District’s attendance boundaries, as it is antithetical to the District’s core purpose of creating safe spaces for learning where student diversity is celebrated and an inherent part of achieving a 21st century education; and, be it finallyResolved, That the Superintendent is directed to formally share the District’s categorical opposition to VisionQuest’s proposal (PAR-2019-5710-CM) with the City of Los Angeles City Clerk’s Office and Los Angeles Planning and Zoning Department.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":1,"meeting_date":"2020-01-14","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":11,"full_name":"Richard Vladovic","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Equity & Access","Facilities & Construction"]}}
