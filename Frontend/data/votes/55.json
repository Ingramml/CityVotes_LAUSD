In the process, potential improvements to SENI should be examined, including factors that prioritize Black student well-being and learning, student and community poverty, stability of local schools and communities, the needs of English language learners, and supports for students with disabilities. The formulas and allocations shall be transparent and be reviewed annually;Resolved further, That the District will demonstrate its commitment to racial justice and equity by stabilizing and improving schools in neighborhoods which have been negatively impacted by racial and economic injustices, disinvestment, and criminalization, and that the District will not advance any policies that would further destabilize these schools or communities; Resolved further, That the District recognizes that empowerment of families, students, staff, and communities are essential components of equity and, as such, the District shall ensure policies focused on equity include a process for democratic decision making that meaningfully engages parents, students, staff, and community at the school-level, within communities of schools, and Districtwide.Resolved further, That at schools with the highest needs, the District shall delineate a set of educational inputs and teaching and learning conditions where students achieve positive academic outcomes regardless of zip code because schools with different needs and challenges will receive different resources; Resolved further, That the District shall develop a definition of equity that accounts for all the factors included in this resolution as well as other factors identified through a formal process of widespread engagement of families, students, staff, communities and other stakeholders and that the District is directed to create and implement such an engagement process;Resolved further, That the District shall not seek to abridge, waive, or compromise the educational rights of its students under federal laws including, but not limited to, Title I, Title II, Title III, Title IV, or Title V and shall not seek to divert funds that are directed towards the education of students under these Titles, or other federal laws, away from these students; and, be it finally Resolved, That the District shall ensure full transparency regarding funding and other educational resources and shall develop, in consultation with a range of community stakeholders, protocols and materials for full transparency.
