{"success":true,"vote":{"id":56,"item_number":"009-21/22","title":"Got a Plan for That? Removing Barriers to College and Career Success (Res-009-21/22)","description":"Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to ensuring that all students graduate college- and career-ready;Whereas, This commitment is demonstrated by the newly adopted college and career readiness goal of the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District; by the resolutions Creating Pathways to Lifelong Success for Our Students (Res-010-17/18) and Accelerating College Access, Awareness, and Attainment (Res-006-21/22); and by the graduation and proficiency goals within the District’s Local Control Accountability Plan;Whereas, Affordability is a primary barrier to college entry, particularly for low-income students, and completing the Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA) or, if a student is undocumented, the California Dream Act Application (CADAA) opens opportunities for financial support to overcome this hurdle;Whereas, Financial aid application completion is a strong predictor of college enrollment and persistence, particularly among low-income students. The National College Attainment Network states that 90 percent of high school seniors who complete the FAFSA attend college directly from high school, compared to just 55 percent of those that do not;Whereas, Assembly Bill 132 and Assembly Bill 469 were recently signed into law, which, beginning in 2022-23, will require school districts to ensure that high school seniors submit a FAFSA or CADAA or an opt-out form;Whereas, The COVID-19 pandemic has caused greater declines in FAFSA submission from students from low-income, Black, and Latino communities compared to their peers in 2020-21. District students graduating in 2020 had a FAFSA completion rate of 65.7 percent, and in 2021 had a completion rate of 63 percent. According to the California Student Aid Commission, FAFSA completion rates fell 25 percent across the State during the 2020-2021 school year. While the District did better than State averages in 2021, thousands of District students still did not have the opportunity to benefit from critical financial support.Whereas, Recognizing this challenge, the District has successfully partnered with college access organizations to enhance its existing and expanding FAFSA and CADAA supports and campaigns to support the completion of student applications; andWhereas, Research shows that requiring a post-graduation plan for high school seniors improves post-graduation outcomes, including increased FAFSA completion rates; now, therefore be it,Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and present a FAFSA Completion Plan (FCP) within 180 days to ensure that starting in the 2022-23 academic year, in compliance with Assembly Bill 132 and Assembly Bill 469, all high school seniors will submit a FAFSA or CADAA application, or complete an opt-out form signed by their parent or guardian. The FCP should:·\tBe developed in partnership and with input from relevant stakeholders, including, but not limited to, Division of Instruction staff, teachers, secondary counselors, students, parents, and representatives from community colleges, universities, community-based organizations, philanthropy, and direct service organizations;·\tInclude recommended strategies and investments, such as: providing additional professional development and planning time for counselors who support students with financial aid applications and post-secondary planning, strategies to leverage each school site Post-Secondary Leadership Team to support Tier 1 approaches to increase FAFSA/CADAA completion efforts, increasing counseling staff, engaging and supporting parents in the financial aid and college application process, differentiating supports for high-need schools and students who have been impacted the most, utilizing existing and novel methods and utilities, such as the use of Naviance and its post-graduation planning platforms, or other student- centered and evidenced-based alternatives, and, expanding partnerships with other public agencies and community based organizations to achieve this milestone;·\tInclude how the District will provide differentiated supports for students eligible for CADAA, including, but not limited to: collaborating with partner organizations such as UnidosUS, MALDEF, CARECEN, CHIRLA, and theDream.US to enhance staff capacity and develop resources for staff, students, and families that meet the unique needs of eligible students;Resolved further, That in order to help students enter the college and career of their choice, the Division of Instruction, in collaboration with the Office of the Superintendent, shall assess and improve the functionality of the Individualized Graduation Plan (IGP) student goal attainment and provide regular updates to the Board which include the following areas as part of the progress monitoring efforts of the adopted Board goals:·\tIdentification of gaps in capacity to meaningfully engage families and students as part of the continuing conversation about college and career readiness, starting as early as Early Transitional Kindergarten and through twelfth grade and recommendations to address those gaps, which may include more regular and responsive tools for staff, students, and families to help monitor student achievement, as well as partnering with community based organizations including but not limited to college-going and faith-based organizations,·\tDevelopment of a post-graduation plan component in the IGP that all high school students will complete each year to help determine goals after graduation and within the individualized culmination plan (ICP) for eighth grade students. Both plans should engage students on their plan in at least one of the following post- secondary pathways: enrollment in a 2 or 4 year college program, a military acceptance or enlistment letter, acceptance to a job program (e.g. coding boot camp), enrollment in a trades pre-apprenticeship or apprenticeship program, plans for a “gap-year,” a current job or job offer letter, or another diverse pathway, such as entrepreneurship, industry certification completion, continued education at a specialty school, or an adult education school;Resolved further, That the District shall review and analyze data collected from post- graduation plans and any accompanying feedback from students and staff to inform the allocation of programs, pathways, partnerships, and supports for students at both the individual school site, Community of School (CoS), and Local District level;Resolved further, That for the 2021-22 school year, the Los Angeles Unified School District will launch a Financial Aid For All campaign to raise awareness of the opportunity to enroll starting October 1st and with the priority deadline of March 2nd, about the importance of college access and financial aid, and to educate students on the net cost of college, like that the cost difference between attending a 4-year and 2-year schools often is negligible once financial aid is included, with the goal of helping, by the 2022-23 school year, increase financial aid application completion to at least 80 percent while striving for 100 percent; and, be it finallyResolved, That the District shall track completion rates for FAFSA or CADAA and the post-graduation plan component of the IGP and ICP; share the results, disaggregated by student groups and by school, to the extent allowable by law, on the District’s Open Data platform; and provide updates to the Board as part of the Board Goals progress monitoring efforts.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":20,"meeting_date":"2021-10-26","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":2,"full_name":"Monica Garcia","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Curriculum & Instruction","Equity & Access","Resolutions & Recognitions"]}}
