These cuts would disproportionately harm students with significant special needs and undermine their right to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE); now, therefore, be it \n \nResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families, particularly in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with disabilities; \n \nResolved Further, That the District formally recognizes December 2 as National Special Education Day this year and every year and encourages all schools, students, and families to celebrate our children with disabilities and the unique assets they contribute to our school communities; \n \nResolved Further, That the Board commits to continued advocacy for the protection of the IDEA and related Federal programs serving students with disabilities and for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the instructional programs and services for our students with disabilities, such as increasing California’s funding allocations to meet the increases in special education costs and Congress increasing the annual appropriations for the IDEA; and, be it finally \n \nResolved, That the District commits to continuing and expanding upon its regular opportunities for parents and families students with disabilities to engage with the District to provide meaningful feedback, opportunities for continuous improvement and strengthen partnerships and resources.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":1,"meeting_id":66,"meeting_date":"2025-12-16","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":12,"full_name":"Jerry Yang","vote_choice":"ABSENT"},{"member_id":5,"full_name":"Karla Griego","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":8,"full_name":"Sherlett H.
