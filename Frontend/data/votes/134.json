Hallinger, 2003; Leithwood,  Louis,  Anderson  & Wahlstrom,  2004, Robinson 2007) consistently shows that the principal’s instructional leadership role  has a strong influence on learner performance and asserts that learner performance is likely to be greater where there is direct principal leadership involvement in planning  and professional  development;Whereas, The UCLA Center for Transformation of Schools has identified obstacles to retaining Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) teachers and recommends that administrators and schools make a strong, lasting commitment to “the ideals and policies that best support students in cultivating critical awareness” and that “the use of standardized tests should be dramatically reduced and supplemented with more authentic and relevant performance assessment”;Whereas, Performance assessment aligns with community-based learning because it enables students to demonstrate their learning in authentic ways and apply their knowledge and skills to new contexts by creating products, presentations and/or demonstrations that reflect understanding and mastery; andWhereas, Hiring Community School Lead Teachers who rely on performance assessment versus student preparation for standardized testing will allow Community Schools to better support all five pillars of LAUSD’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan (Academic Excellence, Joy and Wellness, Engagement and Collaboration, Operational Effectiveness, and Investing in Staff); now, therefore, be itResolved, That the District will establish with the Supporting Meaningful Teaching and Learning Initiative (SMTLI) in order to strengthen the Los Angeles Unified School District Community Schools Initiative (CSI) and fully realize the promise of Community Schools as transformative for teaching, learning, joy and engagement, and student, family, and community well-being;Resolved further, That schools that participate in the five CSI cohorts will be eligible to apply to participate in the SMTLI, and the Community Schools Steering Committee (CSSC) will recommend approval or denial of applications based on established criteria that could include quality of implementation of the Community Schools Framework and evidence of strong academic progress for all student groups, and will be open to up to 10 schools;Resolved further, That STMLI schools will be authorized to select a Community Schools Grant funded Community School Lead Teacher through the Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP), who will support the goal of “remodeling instructional program commitment”;Resolved further, That Lead Teachers will receive professional development by Community School Coaches and UCLA Center for Community Schooling, as well as other relevant partners as appropriate including those with expertise in the support and development of school leaders;Resolved further, That STMLI schools will demonstrate a team commitment that includes, at minimum, the principal, school staff, and the Local School Leadership Council and/or other bodies inclusive of student and parent leadership, and will commit to participating in the Cohort for three years;Resolved further, That STMLI schools will commit to remodeling their existing instruction program to integrate culturally relevant curriculum, community- and project-based learning, and civic engagement (e.g., through the integration of Linked Learning and/or other instructional strategies), and targeted AI integration;Resolved further, That STMLI Principals will commit to engaging in instructional planning, observation of project- based instruction, attend and provide professional development related to community- and project-based learning, and provide sufficient resources for teachers to fully implement project-based learning;Resolved further, That SMTLI schools will work in collaboration with the Division of Instruction to develop and pilot innovative, authentic, rigorous and relevant assessments to provide information to teachers and parents regarding students’ areas of strengths and areas of need. Once established, SMTLI schools will be excused from standardized testing with the exception of state-and federally-mandated assessments; and, be it finallyResolved, That District staff, and labor and other partners will form a team in the second semester of school year 24-25 to develop the operational aspects for how this initiative is to be implemented, and communicated across the systems and structures of the CSI, and to create an application and rubric for approval so that this new initiative can commence on July 1, 2025.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":4,"noes":3,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":50,"meeting_date":"2024-09-10","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"NAY"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"NAY"}],"topics":["Curriculum & Instruction","Health & Nutrition"]}}
