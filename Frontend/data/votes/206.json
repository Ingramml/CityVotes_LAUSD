Consequences: \nA “Yes” vote would effectuate the processing of personnel actions for classified, certificated and senior management employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer and new appointments.\n \nA “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints, impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nNot applicable\n \nBudget Impact: \nCost Neutra. \n \n \n \nStudent Impact:\nNot applicable\n \n \nEquity Impact:\nNot applicable\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nAll actions affecting classified personnel and apprentice personnel reported herein are in accordance with Section 45123-45125, 45135, and 45240-45318 of the Education Code and with the Rules of the Personnel Commission.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A: Administrative Regulations
