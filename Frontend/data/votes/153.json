The budget for the redefined project is $197,435,000, an increase of $73,450,000.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the redefined project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nThe Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Staff initially considered proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings. However, in an effort to maximize efficiencies and expedite the HVAC replacement, Staff recommends that the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project be redefined to include the replacement and upgrade of the existing HVAC systems. Coordinating and performing the proposed replacement and upgrade of the HVAC system in the Main Building, Locker & Shower Building, and Sanitary Buildings concurrently with the planned work of the Classroom Replacement project will streamline design and construction efforts and eliminate any potential duplicative work that may occur with two separate projects and general contractors.\n \nThe proposed redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project includes the following added scope:\n \n•                     Replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, exhaust fans, and miscellaneous ductwork at the Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields.\n \n•                     Installation of a new Energy Management System (EMS) for all permanent and relocatable buildings that will remain after completion of this project.\n \n•                     Installation and removal of interim facilities including approximately 30 classrooms, 2 administrative spaces, and 2 restrooms necessary to support school programs during construction.\n \n•                     Construction of new tennis courts and a new softball field as well as restoration of parking and landscaping where interim facilities and existing relocatable buildings are to be removed.\n \nThe prior scope approved in the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project included the removal of 10 existing relocatable buildings and 3 permanent buildings assuming that a standalone HVAC project would remove an additional 5 existing relocatable buildings and 1 permanent building. The redefined project includes the removal of all 15 existing relocatable buildings and 4 permanent buildings.  The prior definition also included some interim facilities; however, this has been expanded in the redefined project to expedite the replacement of classrooms and HVAC together. The complete scope, budget, and schedule for the redefined project is provided in Exhibit A.\n \nStaff anticipates that construction activities will begin in the 3rd quarter of 2027. The activities for site/utilities/interim facilities may begin in advance of this work in an earlier phase. Construction is anticipated to be completed by the 4th quarter of 2031.\n \nBell High School is located in Region East and Board District 5 (Karla Griego).\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included herein as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified School District’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nStaff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to redefine the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the design and construction of the redefined project.\n \nThe new facilities, once completed, will provide facilities that support education programs and student achievement. The redefined project will also decrease demand for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds for environmental reviews and clearances, design, procurement, construction, and other activities necessary to implement the redefined project.\n \nIf the proposal is not approved, the project will not be redefined, and the school will not benefit from the additional critical replacements and associated campus upgrades being proposed.\n \n \n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. The proposal is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in the District's local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by replacing existing relocatable buildings with new permanent buildings and providing critical replacements and upgrades.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project increases the project budget by $73,450,000, which results in an updated project budget of $197,435,000.  This budget reflects current information known, and assumptions about the project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the project.\n \nThe redefined project, including the new HVAC scope, is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.  This action will require the transfer of $73,450,000 from the SUP category of need for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components to the SUP category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.\n \nStudent Impact:\nThe redefined Bell High School Classroom Replacement project, once completed, will help ensure approximately 2,100 students attending this school are provided with safe, welcoming, and state-of-the-art learning environments that support student-centered and engaged learning.  The redefined project will also ensure the students attending Bell High School are provided with updated facilities that are well-ventilated with efficient heating and air conditioning systems that support learning.\n \nEquity Impact:\nBell High School was prioritized for a classroom replacement project based on 1) the number of relocatable buildings that are not certified by the Division of the State Architect and 2) the number of students served.  The new HVAC scope was prioritized according to the critical replacement criteria of first addressing the building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nThe Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Redefining the Classroom Replacement project instead of proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings will enable staff to better coordinate design and construction efforts, maximize budget efficiencies, and minimize impacts on the learning environment.\n \n \n \n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Scope, Budget, and Schedule for Redefined Project\nExhibit B - BOC Resolution\nExhibit C - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n03/11/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n_____________________________                                                               _____________________________                     \nALBERTO M.
