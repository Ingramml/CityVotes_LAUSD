The proposed site is located at 1371 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  \nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nSTEM Preparatory Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 316 students on a private facility at 1374 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. STEM Preparatory Elementary was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017.\n \nOn August 21, 2025, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of STEM Preparatory Elementary’s complete material revision. STEM Preparatory Elementary seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2026.  \n \nBased on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nCharter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \n“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  \n \n“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. \nPolicy Implications: \nAll provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.                     \n \nBudget Impact: \nState income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. \n \nCharter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.\n \nIn addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.\nAny change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.\n \n \nStudent Impact:\nAs stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nIf all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report\nAttachment B - STEM Preparatory Elementary Data Set \nAttachment C - Material Revision\n \nBudget will be available prior to the board meeting at the following link:\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r3Urkj14bW3MsZpYB9fO2fAaDA4v5-ev?usp=sharing>\n \nSubmitted:\n10/23/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
