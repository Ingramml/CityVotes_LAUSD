New Millennium Secondary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 10, 2008.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 225 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Millennium Secondary expires June 30, 2026.\n \nOn September 19, 2025, New Millennium Secondary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. \n \nAn initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.\n \nBased on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. \n \nDue Diligence:\nCurrent New Millennium Secondary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.\n \nStatutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:\nA charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:\n \nCriterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:\n \n•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;\n•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;\n•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and\n•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).\n \nCriterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.\n                     \nCriterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)\n \nGrounds for Nonrenewal:\nStaff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for New Millennium Secondary and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that (1) as a Middle Performing charter school, Charter School fails to meet or make sufficient progress toward meeting standards that provide a benefit to the pupils of the school; that closure of Charter School is in the best interest of pupils, and this decision to recommend denial provided greater weight to performance on measurements of academic performance; and (2) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the renewal petition.\n \n \nExpected Outcomes:\nDenial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. \n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \n“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 206-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. \n \n“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. \n \nPolicy Implications: \nAll provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.\n \nUnder Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.\n \nCharter School has selected LAUSD SELPA Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s LCFF funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.\n \nIn addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.\n \nAny change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.\n \nStudent Impact:\nAs stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.\n \nEquity Impact:\nNot applicable\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nIf all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.\n \nAttachments:\nAttachment A - Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report \nAttachment B - New Millennium Secondary Data Set\nAttachment C - Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary  \n \nBudget, Petition, and Verified Data Reports (if applicable) will be available prior to the board meeting at the following link:\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GyJMyoPpJFPZSxwBXECoHcmy1fAj8nWm?usp=sharing>\n \nSubmitted:\n11/21/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
