{"success":true,"vote":{"id":119,"item_number":"027-23/24","title":"Éxito y Promesa: Deepening and Expanding Support for Multi Language Learners","description":"Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District is proud to serve students who speak 98 different languages at home;  Whereas, Approximately 85,000 English Learners (EL), and 99,000 Reclassified Fluent English Proficient (RFEP) students make up approximately 44% of all students in the District; Whereas, The Multi Language Learners (MLL) student population is heterogeneous including, among others, Potential Long-Term English Learners (PLTEL), Long-Term English Learners (LTEL), English Learner students with disabilities, English Learners identified as gifted and talented, as well as refugee and International Newcomer students, an MLL student population that has been rising steadily in recent years; Whereas, The District is committed to supporting students who are Multi-Language Learners, including approximately 22,000 (5%) who are International Newcomers, as evidenced by ongoing efforts outlined in the District’s Strategic Plan including targeted professional development, assigning trained staff to schools with a high concentration of International Newcomer students, providing instructional resources with EL-specific strategies to all teachers, assigning Multilingual Multicultural Academic Language Teams that support each region, and the creation of four International Network Academies and Dream Centers;Whereas, The District is focused on decreasing the number of LTELs by providing targeted, supplemental supports in elementary and middle schools through the allocation of support staff who provide direct services to students and work with teachers to implement research-based strategies such as those highlighted in LAUSD UTK-12 Essential Instructional Approaches for Multilingual Learners;Whereas, The District provides supports to MLL students in the earliest years who attend preschool programs at the Early Education Centers and elementary schools, including a growing number of dual language early learning programs wherein MLL students can nurture their emerging bilingualism in a culturally relevant environment; Whereas, A measure of success for eliminating opportunity gaps is increasing EL reclassification rates to 25% (from 15.8% in 2019-20), and in the first year of the Strategic Plan, the District showed improvement in this area by increasing its EL reclassification rates to 21.8%;Whereas, The 2023 Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) results show English Learners as the student group with the greatest Distance from Standard in English Language Arts, where the SBAs are comprehensive end-of-year assessments for English Language Arts/literacy and mathematics that measure progress toward college and career readiness;   Whereas, MLL high school students have class schedules that include state-required English Language Development (ELD) courses to achieve English proficiency which may delay access to a full range of courses, and the District is piloting a new grade-level ELD placement policy to expand ELs’ access to grade- level coursework, including expediting International Newcomers’ access to electives/grade-level English courses after their first year of ELD instruction; Whereas, Newcomer students are a part of the overall MLL population but may also have unique needs, reflecting the traumas of the migration process, interrupted formal education, or other challenges, which necessitate specialized resources and programming;  Whereas, While wraparound services are available to newcomer students at the secondary level, resource gaps may exist in supporting newcomer students in early learning programs and elementary schools;Whereas, the 2022-2025 UTLA collective bargaining agreement includes a side letter Memorandum of Understanding “Support for Immigrant Students and Families”, which includes establishing the joint District and UTLA “Immigrant Support Committee;” andWhereas, The Strategic Plan indicates that the District will pursue eliminating opportunity gaps by creating an inclusive environment, acting on early warning indicators to ensure students remain on track, and offering multiple opportunities for intervention and credit recovery during and after school, among other strategies; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that all MLL students have access to a rigorous, well-rounded, high-quality public education;  Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall assess the holistic needs of MLL students and their families, the current provision of services, and explore additional strategies to deepen support, including:·\tIncreasing access to a diverse academic portfolio (including A-G coursework, electives and the arts), dual language immersion programs starting from the earliest years, enrichment opportunities, extracurricular activities, technology, social-emotional resources, and opportunities for additional supports outside of instructional time;·\tUpdating protocols and processes for communications with families to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness, awareness and understanding, including the benefits of and resources for supporting their home language while also learning English, the reclassification process and college preparation (e.g. for undocumented students and their unique financial aid needs), and improving partnership with families so they can be equipped and empowered to support their children’s learning at home;·\tIncreasing access to language/interpretation services, especially in school communities where languages are spoken besides English and Spanish, such as Russian, Ukrainian, and indigenous languages from around the world;·\tBuilding the capacity of certificated and classified employees to support all MLL students through culturally responsive practices and awareness of the social-emotional needs of newcomers, and creating career pathways including “grow your own” programs to ensure a pipeline of teachers and staff who can meet the diverse needs of MLL and newcomer students beginning in preschool and transitional kindergarten;·\tCreating partnerships with academic institutions and organizations specializing in multicultural education and the needs of International Newcomers as well as legal aid organizations or pro bono programs to provide legal support to immigrant students and their families; ·\tProviding additional support to schools with high concentrations of MLL students and International Newcomers, such as additional staff, financial resources, multilingual learning materials, dual language immersion programs from the earliest years,  and wraparound services (e.g. legal and social-emotional support and resource hubs, such as Dream Resource Centers and enrollment supports, such as additional School Enrollment, Placement and Assessment (SEPA) Centers), and considering opportunities to add supports to schools midyear based on recent arrivals;·\tIncorporating, in the District’s annual legislative and advocacy priorities, legislation that helps support the diverse needs of MLL and newcomer students; and be it finally Resolved, That, with input from students, educators, staff, families, community organizations, and the LAUSD-UTLA Immigrant Support Committee, the Superintendent shall develop a revised Master Plan for English Learners for the 2025-2026 school year to fulfill the promise of our MLL students by addressing gaps in each of the areas listed above and report back to the Board on the implementation of the resolution and overall investments made on behalf of MLL students in 120 days and as part of the annual Strategic Plan.","outcome":"PASS","ayes":7,"noes":0,"abstain":0,"absent":0,"meeting_id":46,"meeting_date":"2024-05-07","meeting_type":"regular","member_votes":[{"member_id":6,"full_name":"George McKenna III","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":3,"full_name":"Jackie Goldberg","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":4,"full_name":"Kelly Gonez","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":7,"full_name":"Nick Melvoin","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":9,"full_name":"Rocio Rivas","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":10,"full_name":"Scott Schmerelson","vote_choice":"AYE"},{"member_id":1,"full_name":"Tanya Ortiz Franklin","vote_choice":"AYE"}],"topics":["Curriculum & Instruction","Labor & Employment"]}}
