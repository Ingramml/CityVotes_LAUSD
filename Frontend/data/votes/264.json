As a condition of this funding, LAUSD must submit a Board Resolution affirming compliance with Education Code § 8973, which allows kindergarten within an early primary program to exceed four hours (exclusive of recesses) provided the day does not exceed the length of the primary grade day and the program offers ample opportunities for both active and quiet, developmentally appropriate instruction. While LAUSD currently operates an extended-day kindergarten program that meets these criteria, the required Board Resolution certifying compliance has not yet been adopted.\n \nTransitional Kindergarten (TK) is part of a two-year kindergarten program. Students are placed in TK the first year and kindergarten in the second year based on age level eligibility. This program is developmentally appropriate, and standards align instruction, while providing ample opportunities for active and quiet activities as necessary.\nend\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nUpon adoption of the attached resolution, the District will be compliant with Education Code Section 8973. In addition, staff will be able to certify that the declaration requirement of the Grant has been met.\nend\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nIf the proposed resolution is not approved, the District will not be compliant with EC section 8973, and the District will be obligated to return the $4,459,128 in State grant funds already received for the Project, plus interest. The District would then need to use local bond funds to cover the loss of State funds and would become ineligible to receive other State grants for extended-day kindergarten facilities.\nend\n \nPolicy Implications: \nStaff’s proposal also aligns with Pillar 2, Priority A (Joy and Wellness: Welcoming Learning Environments) and Pillar 4, Priority B (Operational Effectiveness: Modernizing Infrastructure) of LAUSD’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by facilitating student access to safe and healthy learning environments.\n..end\n \nBudget Impact: \nThe Project is funded by the Grant and Bond Program funds earmarked for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. This action will not affect the Board-approved budget for the Project, but failure to pass the proposed resolution would necessitate replacement of the State Grant funds with Bond Program funds. The action does not have an impact on General Funds.\nend\n \nStudent Impact: \nApproval of this action will also allow LAUSD to comply with the requirements of the Grant, thus enabling the District to retain existing state funding and possibly receive future funding to construct new classrooms and modernize existing facilities, which will facilitate student access to safe and healthy learning environments.\nend\n \nEquity Impact: \nEC section 8973 allows for extended-day kindergarten programs, which can exceed the standard four-hour day, provided the district's governing board declares the extended day does not exceed the length of the primary school day and the program integrates ample time for both active and quiet activities.\nend\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nAdopting the resolution will bring the District into compliance with EC section 8973 for extended-day kindergarten, while supporting the implementation of the Project. It will not alter the Board-approved Project scope or alter how the District implements extended-day kindergarten.\nend\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A: Resolution of the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District Certifying Compliance with California Education Code section 8973\n \nSubmitted:\n10/23/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
