These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.\n \nProject scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.\n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nExecution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the school and its students.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment.

Nineteen projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Eight projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.\n \nEach project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.\n \nStudent Impact:\nThe proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 11,900 current and future students.\n \nEquity Impact: \nBoard Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nThis report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects\nExhibit B - BOC Resolution\nExhibit C - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n05/05/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               _____________________________\nALBERTO M.
