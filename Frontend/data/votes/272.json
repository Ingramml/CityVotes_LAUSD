The total combined budget for the six proposed projects is $55,059,901.\n \nAuthorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nend\n \nBody\nBackground: \nOn October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  \n \nUnder the Transition Plan, each school is assigned to one of three levels of accessibility (Category One, Two, or Three) based on assessments of more than two dozen criteria including school programs, matriculation options, feeder pattern, geographic location, known (or anticipated/matriculating) population of students with disabilities or parents/guardians with disabilities, type of instructional model, and public input. The assigned category reflects the level of accessibility the site needs to meet. Schools that do not yet meet the criteria for their assigned category will undergo accessibility improvements and are prioritized for project development based on the criteria mentioned above. The three categories of accessibility are as follows: \n \n₋                     Category One: These are “key” schools and will have the highest level of access, generally in accordance with applicable physical accessibility standards. Category 1A will provide “full accessibility” for the schools that were built to new construction standards, while Category 1B will provide “high accessibility” for schools that have been altered with some limited exceptions.\n \n₋                     Category Two: These will be “program-accessible” schools. The core spaces and features of these schools would be made accessible; in addition, program accessibility would be provided to all programs and activities at the school. \n \n₋                     Category Three: These schools will have “core access,” which means that the core spaces (certain common spaces) would be made accessible, to ensure a basic level of access to the building. These include, for example, parking, the main entrance and main office, assembly areas, and some restrooms.\n \nThe six school sites for which an accessibility enhancement project is being proposed do not yet meet their assigned category/level of accessibility and thus require facilities improvements. The scope, schedule, and budget for each proposed project reflects the existing known conditions at each school site and the improvements necessary to meet each school’s assigned category of accessibility. The conditions of significance include acreage, topography, square footage, existence of multi-story buildings, age of buildings, as well as the number of schools, programs, features, and activities at a school site. \n \nBond Oversight Committee Recommendations:\nThis item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit C. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit D. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.\n \nExpected Outcomes:\nDefine and approve six accessibility enhancement projects as detailed in Exhibit A and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects.\n \nBoard Options and Consequences: \nAdoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately begin designing the proposed projects at six school sites.  \n \nIf the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the six proposed accessibility enhancement projects, which are necessary to achieve program accessibility as outlined in the Transition Plan and are required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.\n \nPolicy Implications: \nThe proposal furthers the implementation of the Transition Plan. As outlined in the Transition Plan, at Category One, Two, and Three schools, an appropriate number of classrooms will be identified to serve as accessible learning spaces, some of which may require facility improvements to meet the criteria for their assigned accessibility category. Additionally, the proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements at schools.\n \nAny potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves. This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. \n \nBudget Impact: \nThe total combined budget, as currently estimated, for the six proposed projects is $55,059,901. The proposed projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.\n \nEach project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.\n \nStudent Impact: \nThe six proposed projects will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 4,870 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at each campus.\n \nEquity Impact:\nFacilities work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.\n \nIssues and Analysis: \nBoth Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability. As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible. While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities. These proposed projects are in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Transition Plan.\n \nThe Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n \nAttachments:\nExhibit A - Six Accessibility Enhancement Projects\nExhibit B - Student Eligibility by Program at Six Schools \nExhibit C - BOC Resolution\nExhibit D - BOC Presentation\n \nSubmitted:\n10/23/25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,                                                               APPROVED BY:\n \n \n \n______________________________                                                               ______________________________\nALBERTO M.
