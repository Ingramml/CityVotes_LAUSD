The National College Attainment Network states that 90 percent of high school seniors who complete the FAFSA attend college directly from high school, compared to just 55 percent of those that do not;Whereas, Assembly Bill 132 and Assembly Bill 469 were recently signed into law, which, beginning in 2022-23, will require school districts to ensure that high school seniors submit a FAFSA or CADAA or an opt-out form;Whereas, The COVID-19 pandemic has caused greater declines in FAFSA submission from students from low-income, Black, and Latino communities compared to their peers in 2020-21. District students graduating in 2020 had a FAFSA completion rate of 65.7 percent, and in 2021 had a completion rate of 63 percent. According to the California Student Aid Commission, FAFSA completion rates fell 25 percent across the State during the 2020-2021 school year. While the District did better than State averages in 2021, thousands of District students still did not have the opportunity to benefit from critical financial support.Whereas, Recognizing this challenge, the District has successfully partnered with college access organizations to enhance its existing and expanding FAFSA and CADAA supports and campaigns to support the completion of student applications; andWhereas, Research shows that requiring a post-graduation plan for high school seniors improves post-graduation outcomes, including increased FAFSA completion rates; now, therefore be it,Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and present a FAFSA Completion Plan (FCP) within 180 days to ensure that starting in the 2022-23 academic year, in compliance with Assembly Bill 132 and Assembly Bill 469, all high school seniors will submit a FAFSA or CADAA application, or complete an opt-out form signed by their parent or guardian.

Both plans should engage students on their plan in at least one of the following post- secondary pathways: enrollment in a 2 or 4 year college program, a military acceptance or enlistment letter, acceptance to a job program (e.g. coding boot camp), enrollment in a trades pre-apprenticeship or apprenticeship program, plans for a “gap-year,” a current job or job offer letter, or another diverse pathway, such as entrepreneurship, industry certification completion, continued education at a specialty school, or an adult education school;Resolved further, That the District shall review and analyze data collected from post- graduation plans and any accompanying feedback from students and staff to inform the allocation of programs, pathways, partnerships, and supports for students at both the individual school site, Community of School (CoS), and Local District level;Resolved further, That for the 2021-22 school year, the Los Angeles Unified School District will launch a Financial Aid For All campaign to raise awareness of the opportunity to enroll starting October 1st and with the priority deadline of March 2nd, about the importance of college access and financial aid, and to educate students on the net cost of college, like that the cost difference between attending a 4-year and 2-year schools often is negligible once financial aid is included, with the goal of helping, by the 2022-23 school year, increase financial aid application completion to at least 80 percent while striving for 100 percent; and, be it finallyResolved, That the District shall track completion rates for FAFSA or CADAA and the post-graduation plan component of the IGP and ICP; share the results, disaggregated by student groups and by school, to the extent allowable by law, on the District’s Open Data platform; and provide updates to the Board as part of the Board Goals progress monitoring efforts.",FileMaker Resolutions DB,2021-10-12,Nick Melvoin,Tanya Ortiz Franklin; Monica Garcia; Kelly Gonez; Parishi Kanuga,Parishi Kanuga: Yes
