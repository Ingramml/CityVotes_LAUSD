Whereas, The District proudly serves students self-identified as American Indian /Alaskan Native and Indigenous, including those who are Gabrieleno Tongva and FernandenÞo Tataviam, and the District is pursuing a campaign to improve identification of this student group; Whereas, From an early age students are exposed to pervasive cultural narratives that normalize eurocentrism and white supremacy, which can promote anti-indigeneity and erasure of minority students and be alienating for native and indigenous students;Whereas, In 2020 the District took a significant step to combat this history of exclusion in the curriculum and adopted the resolution “Ethnic Studies for All Students: Reaffirming our commitment to Ethnic Studies in Los Angeles Unified” to further expand the ethnic studies curriculum throughout all grade levels and make the completion of at least one ethnic studies course a high school graduation requirement starting in the current school year 2024-25 (Res-001-20/21); Whereas, The District has previously formally recognized the historical and current injustices committed against native and indigenous groups and disinvestment in native and indigenous students and, in 2021, the Board created a 10 million dollar fund dedicated to supporting the unique needs of Native American and Indigenous students and ensuring LAUSD schools affirm their linguistic, cultural, and historic backgrounds and promote their achievement and wellbeing; Whereas, In 2021 the District formally urged the Office of Federal Acknowledgement within the Office of the Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior to grant long overdue formal Federal recognition of The FernandenÞo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians (Res-017-20/21); andWhereas, The District must join the State of California and County of Los Angeles in exploring the historical relationship between the District, Native Americans and indigenous students and families in the spirit of truth, healing, and reconciliation; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District apologizes on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified School District to tribal governments and communities for the history of maltreatment, subjugation, neglect and trauma that the California public education system has inflicted on the Gabrieleno Tongva, FernandenÞo Tataviam, and other local tribes; Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that colonization in what now constitutes Los Angeles Unified School boundaries resulted in land seizure, disease, slavery, relocation, genocide, multigenerational trauma, and educational disparities, and we are committed to truth, healing, cooperation and to elevating the stories, culture, and community of the original inhabitants of this land; Resolved further, That the District shall collaborate with local recognized tribes to develop a public land acknowledgement statement on behalf of the District accompanied by an educational campaign to raise awareness and ensure students have access to educational resources that support their understanding of the history of the land and the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians;Resolved further, recognizing that current and past students have tribal lineages from across Southern California, the United States, and the world, the District shall collaborate with the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and indigenous organizations to explore the historical record and relationship between the District and native and indigenous students, families, and communities; and to produce a historical record of the local tribes and resources that provide context and additional detail on the meaning and need for a District land acknowledgment; Resolved further, That the forthcoming public land acknowledgement be brought back to the Board for a formal vote no later than April 2025 and, once approved, be publicly posted on the District’s website with the aforementioned resources relating the historical record and District’s relationship with the tribes and the accompanying educational resources and tools for students, P-12 educators, and school communities to utilize; Resolved further, That the District explore the feasibility and options for honoring the history of the land occupied by the District and atoning for past injustices, reporting back on the findings when the land acknowledgement is considered, including: ·	Providing professional development to educators at all grade levels on native histories, the impact of colonization on native tribes and on the land we now occupy, and on the continued existence and culture of local tribes;·	Providing an update on and promoting the Indigenous student identification campaign effort currently underway with the goal of better capturing the number of American Indian/Alaskan Native and Indigenous students served by the District;

California also has 29 percent of the homeless youth in the country, the largest number of homeless youth of any state; Whereas, An estimated 44,007 children and youth experienced homelessness in Los Angeles County in the 2023-2024 school year;Whereas, Runaway and homeless youth flee conflict, abuse, neglect, or increasingly, poverty in their homes. They have become disconnected from educational systems and the workforce, and do not have the skills and financial resources to live on their own. The factors impacting youth homelessness are complex and differ from those impacting other homeless populations; Whereas, Runaway and homeless youth who live on the street are victims of physical abuse, sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and crime in untold numbers. An estimated 300,000 youth are either victims or at risk of becoming victims of the commercial sexual exploitation of children each year, and sixty percent of these victimized children are homeless; Whereas, Homeless youth tend to have started using drugs at a younger age, often before 15 years of age. Early drug use and abuse is predictive of serious adult addiction problems and long-term homelessness; Whereas, Youth who “age out” of the foster care system are at an increased risk of homelessness, and represent an estimated 20 percent of the 20,000 youth who leave foster care and are currently homeless; Whereas, Youth without a high school diploma are 346 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their peers who complete high school; Whereas, Providing safe, stable, and permanent housing for runaway and homeless youth is a family, community, state, and national priority, and homeless youth are considered one of the unique populations in the homeless community by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness; Whereas, The future well-being of our state depends on the value we place on our youth, and, in particular, on our actions to provide the most vulnerable young people in the state with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to find and maintain stable housing and develop into healthy and productive adults; Whereas, When targeted resources are invested, we see a significant increase in the number of communities with youth-specific housing and programs that will help prevent youth from becoming chronically homeless. California has increased the number of youth beds from 3,159 in 2015 to 6,240 in 2023; Whereas, The California Coalition for Youth has operated the California Youth Crisis Line (1-800-843-5200), 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years as the state’s only emergency response system for youth in crisis, and which began offering chat-to-text counseling services in 2016; Whereas, The California Coalition for Youth, along with other community-based organizations, providers, and advocates, are sponsoring California’s thirteenth annual Runaway and Homeless Youth Prevention Month to increase awareness and action on behalf of youth at risk or currently living on the street; Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the important role education can play in preventing and ending youth homelessness; the District provides assistance to children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness ensuring the their access to the same free, appropriate public education, including public preschools, provided to other children and youth; andWhereas, Awareness of the tragedy of youth experiencing homelessness and its causes must be heightened to ensure greater support for effective programs aimed at preventing homelessness and helping youth remain off the streets; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District declares November 2024 Homeless Youth Awareness Month; and, be it finally 	Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the unique challenges of youth experiencing homelessness and commits to increasing awareness of the issues impacting these students and will continue to support and explore programs, partnerships, and legislation that combat homelessness and remove barriers to success for homeless youth.",FileMaker Resolutions DB,2024-10-22,George McKenna III,Scott Schmerelson; Rocio Rivas; Nick Melvoin; Kelly Gonez,Anely Cortez Lopez: Yes,Absent,Yes,Yes,Yes,Absent,Yes,Yes
