    "language": "Whereas, Before and afterschool programs, support students, families and communities. They keep youth safe, inspire learning, and give working parents and guardians peace of mind;Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to delivering well-rounded, inspiring educational and enrichment experiences during the school day and before and after school as outlined in Pillar 1B of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan;Whereas, The average workday for full time workers is 8.4 hours according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, while the average school day for students in California is 6 hours; Whereas, Quality before and afterschool programs not only promote physical health and wellbeing, but also support academic and social-emotional development and provide a safe and supportive environment for students; Whereas, According to research at the University of California, Irvine, the University of Wisconsin Madison, and Policy Studies Associates, Inc., students who regularly attended high-quality afterschool programs had significant gains in standardized math test scores;Whereas, According to the Rose Institute at Claremont Mckenna College, every $1 invested in afterschool programs saves at least $3 through increasing youth\u2019s earning potential, improving their performance at school, and reducing crime and juvenile delinquency;Whereas, Effective before and afterschool programs align with and complement the school day instructional goals. This helps reinforce academic skills and concepts while providing additional enrichment and opportunities for hands-on learning;Whereas, The District and its partners are committed to ensuring students have access to before and afterschool programs in a safe and supportive environment that offers high-quality academic, enrichment, and recreation programs to motivate students to work towards their full potential. Most District students have access to an on-site before and/or afterschool program, although availability and quality may vary from school to school; Whereas, There are challenges to providing quality before and afterschool programs including attracting and retaining qualified, part-time afterschool employees, developing coherence between the school day and before and afterschool programs, and blending funding to meet the needs of all students while following funding guidelines;Whereas, There remains unmet demand for high-quality before and afterschool programs, disproportionately impacting low-income families and families of color; now therefore be itResolved, That the District recognizes and celebrates Lights on Afterschool Day annually in October. This event celebrates after school programs that keep youth safe, inspire them to learn, and help working families;Resolved, That advocacy for more before and afterschool funding and support be incorporated into the 2024 District\u2019s Advocacy Agenda as a legislative priority at the local, State, and national level; Resolved, That the District will continue to strengthen before and afterschool program coherence, quality, developmental appropriateness, and accessibility. Progress towards implementing the District\u2019s Strategic Plan in this area, including an articulation of the broader goals for before and afterschool programs and metrics of success will be presented to the Board in a public meeting within 120 days. These goals and metrics for success shall be informed by:           \u00b7\tAn analysis of current afterschool programs serving District students, including but not limited to         o\tNumber of students currently participating in afterschool programs, broken down by, grade level, race/ethnicity, school of attendance, SENI band, school designation as appropriate, and region;         o\tList of schools providing afterschool programs by type (i.e., District provided vs partner provided, paid program vs. no cost);         o\tStudent outcomes \u2014 including academic and social emotional \u2014 associated with participation in afterschool programs offered at District sites; and          \u00b7\tStakeholder input, including from parents and students, to improve the coherence, quality, and accessibility of before and afterschool programs throughout the District; and, be it finally  Resolved, That the District will participate in local and State conversations and convenings related to before and afterschool programs for youth including around quality standards and impact on student outcomes.",
