    "title": "Reckoning with Our Past, Honoring Our Present: Developing a Los Angeles Unified Land Acknowledgement (Res-017-24/25)",
    "language": "Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) recognizes that we occupy land that was originally and is still inhabited and cared for by the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and Fernanden\u00deo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians;Whereas, The Gabrieleno Tongva People inhabited the region Tovangar, known today as the Greater Los Angeles Basin, which is the distinct community of the present day San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians (Gabrieleno Tongva Tribal Council) that originated in the cultures of the period preceding the establishment of the San Gabriel Mission from which the natives received the name Gabrieleno;Whereas, The Fernandeno Tataviam People inhabited the region of Northern Los Angeles County and eastern Ventura County that includes San Fernando, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, and Antelope Valleys that originated in the cultures of the period preceding the establishment of Mission San Fernando from which the natives received the name Fernande\u00f1o; Whereas, The District proudly serves students self-identified as American Indian /Alaskan Native and Indigenous, including those who are Gabrieleno Tongva and Fernanden\u00deo Tataviam, and the District is pursuing a campaign to improve identification of this student group; Whereas, From an early age students are exposed to pervasive cultural narratives that normalize eurocentrism and white supremacy, which can promote anti-indigeneity and erasure of minority students and be alienating for native and indigenous students;Whereas, In 2020 the District took a significant step to combat this history of exclusion in the curriculum and adopted the resolution \u201cEthnic Studies for All Students: Reaffirming our commitment to Ethnic Studies in Los Angeles Unified\u201d to further expand the ethnic studies curriculum throughout all grade levels and make the completion of at least one ethnic studies course a high school graduation requirement starting in the current school year 2024-25 (Res-001-20/21); Whereas, The District has previously formally recognized the historical and current injustices committed against native and indigenous groups and disinvestment in native and indigenous students and, in 2021, the Board created a 10 million dollar fund dedicated to supporting the unique needs of Native American and Indigenous students and ensuring LAUSD schools affirm their linguistic, cultural, and historic backgrounds and promote their achievement and wellbeing; Whereas, In 2021 the District formally urged the Office of Federal Acknowledgement within the Office of the Assistant Secretary \u2013 Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior to grant long overdue formal Federal recognition of The Fernanden\u00deo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians (Res-017-20/21); andWhereas, The District must join the State of California and County of Los Angeles in exploring the historical relationship between the District, Native Americans and indigenous students and families in the spirit of truth, healing, and reconciliation; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District apologizes on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified School District to tribal governments and communities for the history of maltreatment, subjugation, neglect and trauma that the California public education system has inflicted on the Gabrieleno Tongva, Fernanden\u00deo Tataviam, and other local tribes; Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that colonization in what now constitutes Los Angeles Unified School boundaries resulted in land seizure, disease, slavery, relocation, genocide, multigenerational trauma, and educational disparities, and we are committed to truth, healing, cooperation and to elevating the stories, culture, and community of the original inhabitants of this land; Resolved further, That the District shall collaborate with local recognized tribes to develop a public land acknowledgement statement on behalf of the District accompanied by an educational campaign to raise awareness and ensure students have access to educational resources that support their understanding of the history of the land and the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernande\u00f1o Tataviam Band of Mission Indians;Resolved further, recognizing that current and past students have tribal lineages from across Southern California, the United States, and the world, the District shall collaborate with the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernande\u00f1o Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and indigenous organizations to explore the historical record and relationship between the District and native and indigenous students, families, and communities; and to produce a historical record of the local tribes and resources that provide context and additional detail on the meaning and need for a District land acknowledgment; Resolved further, That the forthcoming public land acknowledgement be brought back to the Board for a formal vote no later than April 2025 and, once approved, be publicly posted on the District\u2019s website with the aforementioned resources relating the historical record and District\u2019s relationship with the tribes and the accompanying educational resources and tools for students, P-12 educators, and school communities to utilize; Resolved further, That the District explore the feasibility and options for honoring the history of the land occupied by the District and atoning for past injustices, reporting back on the findings when the land acknowledgement is considered, including: \u00b7\tProviding professional development to educators at all grade levels on native histories, the impact of colonization on native tribes and on the land we now occupy, and on the continued existence and culture of local tribes;\u00b7\tProviding an update on and promoting the Indigenous student identification campaign effort currently underway with the goal of better capturing the number of American Indian/Alaskan Native and Indigenous students served by the District; \u00b7\tInclusion of stories, literature, and instruction that centers native voice and native tribes throughout the curricula, especially in grades TK-8, and providing an update to the Board on the implementation of AB1703 and AB1821 to provide accurate instruction on the treatment of Native Americans during Spanish colonization in California; \u00b7\tDistrict review of school names and mascots to ensure they comply with our existing policies around cultural sensitivities and affirmations in alignment with AB 3074; \u00b7\tEnsuring the continued provision of a dedicated position to work with the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians, the Fernande\u00f1o Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and other tribes in alignment with the current efforts of the Multilingual and Multicultural Education Department; \u00b7\tPrioritizing the inclusion of native plants in the District\u2019s design plans for outdoor improvements and greening projects; \u00b7\tProviding resources to educators in recognition of Indigenous People\u2019s Day, National Day of Remembrance, California Native American Day, Native American Heritage Month, and, where appropriate, National Awareness Day for Missing or Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls;\u00b7\tIncreasing the representation of native artists in the painting of murals on school campuses;  \u00b7\tOptions for formally observing Indigenous People\u2019s Day as part of the District\u2019s the instructional calendar;\u00b7\tInvesting financial resources in the preservation of tribal cultural education and land resources to lift the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernande\u00f1o Tataviam Band of Mission Indians, including but not limited to, restoring and preserving Gabrielino Tongva Springs and supporting tribal stewardship opportunities;\u00b7\tIncluding names of original tribal villages and places on sites that schools now occupy through plaques or other physical commemorations and, be it finallyResolved, That the District reaffirms its support and advocacy for the federal recognition of the Gabrieleno/Tongva San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernanden\u00deo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and commits itself to advocating for the federal recognition of the First People of Los Angeles County.",

    "title": "Recognizing November as National Runaway and Homeless Youth Prevention Month (Res-020-24/25)",
    "language": "Whereas, November is National Runaway and Homeless Youth Prevention Month;\u00a0Whereas, Runaway and homeless youth, defined as young people between 12 and 24 years of age, have the least access to essential opportunities and supports;\u00a0Whereas, The prevalence of runaways and homelessness among youth is staggering, with studies suggesting that nationally between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 youth up to 24 years of age experience homelessness every year, of which an overrepresentation, compared to the general youth population, are youth of color, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender;\u00a0Whereas, Based on national surveys and California\u2019s youth population, an estimated 200,000 youth under 18 years of age, and thousands more who are 18 to 24 years of age, are homeless for one or more days each year; Whereas, The percentage of unaccompanied homeless youth who are unsheltered in California stands at 68.2 percent, which is the second highest in the country. California also has 29 percent of the homeless youth in the country, the largest number of homeless youth of any state;\u00a0Whereas, An estimated 44,007 children and youth experienced homelessness in Los Angeles County in the 2023-2024 school year;Whereas, Runaway and homeless youth flee conflict, abuse, neglect, or increasingly, poverty in their homes. They have become disconnected from educational systems and the workforce, and do not have the skills and financial resources to live on their own. The factors impacting youth homelessness are complex and differ from those impacting other homeless populations; Whereas, Runaway and homeless youth who live on the street are victims of physical abuse, sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and crime in untold numbers. An estimated 300,000 youth are either victims or at risk of becoming victims of the commercial sexual exploitation of children each year, and sixty percent of these victimized children are homeless; Whereas, Homeless youth tend to have started using drugs at a younger age, often before 15 years of age. Early drug use and abuse is predictive of serious adult addiction problems and long-term homelessness; Whereas, Youth who \u201cage out\u201d of the foster care system are at an increased risk of homelessness, and represent an estimated 20 percent of the 20,000 youth who leave foster care and are currently homeless;\u00a0Whereas, Youth without a high school diploma are 346 percent more likely to experience homelessness than their peers who complete high school; Whereas, Providing safe, stable, and permanent housing for runaway and homeless youth is a family, community, state, and national priority, and homeless youth are considered one of the unique populations in the homeless community by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness;\u00a0Whereas, The future well-being of our state depends on the value we place on our youth, and, in particular, on our actions to provide the most vulnerable young people in the state with opportunities to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to find and maintain stable housing and develop into healthy and productive adults; Whereas, When targeted resources are invested, we see a significant increase in the number of communities with youth-specific housing and programs that will help prevent youth from becoming chronically homeless. California has increased the number of youth beds from 3,159 in 2015 to 6,240 in 2023;\u00a0Whereas, The California Coalition for Youth has operated the California Youth Crisis Line (1-800-843-5200), 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years as the state\u2019s only emergency response system for youth in crisis, and which began offering chat-to-text counseling services in 2016; Whereas, The California Coalition for Youth, along with other community-based organizations, providers, and advocates, are sponsoring California\u2019s thirteenth annual Runaway and Homeless Youth Prevention Month to increase awareness and action on behalf of youth at risk or currently living on the street; Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the important role education can play in preventing and ending\u00a0youth homelessness; the District provides assistance to children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness ensuring the their access to the same free, appropriate public education, including public preschools, provided to other children and youth; andWhereas, Awareness of the tragedy of youth experiencing homelessness and its causes must be heightened to ensure greater support for effective programs aimed at preventing homelessness and helping youth remain off the streets; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District declares November 2024\u00a0Homeless\u00a0Youth\u00a0Awareness Month; and, be it finally\u00a0\tResolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the unique challenges of\u00a0youth experiencing\u00a0homelessness and commits to increasing awareness of the issues impacting these students and will continue to support and explore programs, partnerships, and legislation that combat homelessness and remove barriers to success for\u00a0homeless\u00a0youth.",

    "language": "Whereas, The 2024 presidential contest led to the election of a candidate who mounted an authoritarian campaign which promised to dissolve public agencies, erode the autonomy of public institutions including public schools, and roll back progress for numerous communities that Los Angeles Unified School District serves every day including immigrants, women, non-binary, LGBTQ+, working class, and poor people; Whereas, Working for the Heritage Foundation, associates of the President-elect and likely members of the next administration created a 2025 Presidential Transition Project, known as Project 2025, which is explicitly intended as a blueprint for the next administration, and which lays out policies that would erode civil liberties, the separation of church and state, and the rule of law, and would undermine or abolish critical government agencies including the Department of Education;Whereas, The enactment of the policies found in the 920-page \u201cProject 2025 Mandate for Leadership\u201d would do immediate, incalculable, and irreparable harm to public school students, families, and staff, as well as the entire institution of public education in this country; andWhereas, On October 2, 2024, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Superintendent, and labor partners convened to announce L.A. Unified 2025, an affirmation of the District\u2019s commitment to an inclusive, safe, and welcoming school district for all students, employees, and families; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the policy of Los Angeles Unified School District is the LA Unified 2025 vision, which stands in unity with all of the students, families, and staff in our school communities and embraces Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion throughout the District; Resolved further, That the LA Unified 2025 vision means that we will do everything in our power to protect and defend students, families, and staff from the harm intended by Project 2025, and to defend all students\u2019 right to a public education; and, be it finallyResolved, That within 60 days, the Superintendent will present to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District a formal L.A. Unified 2025 plan that provides a comprehensive overview of all of the Project 2025 policies that impact public education and public school students, families, and staff, and a detailed overview of the District\u2019s plan to defend public education and the students, families, and staff we serve as the next administration seeks to implement these and similar policies.",
