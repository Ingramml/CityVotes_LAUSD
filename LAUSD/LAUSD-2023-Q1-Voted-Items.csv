While we celebrate many female leaders, and the progress made towards gender equality, we acknowledge that women still face many societal barriers.  For example, women still only earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and the wage gap is even larger for women of color, with Black women earning 64 cents, and Hispanic women earning 57 cents despite having high rates of workforce participation;Whereas, For more than 100 years, International Women's Day has been a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women and marks a call to action for accelerating women's equity and equality;Whereas, The 2023 theme for International Women’s Day is #EmbraceEquity which focuses on creating a more inclusive world, challenging stereotypes and addressing discrimination;Whereas, The 2023 theme for Women’s History Month, Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories, recognizes women, past and present, who have been active in all forms of media and storytelling;  Whereas, Many women raise awareness and reject stereotypes about women and women of color, as well as create space for voices and counternarratives of women of color;Whereas, The conversation of women and women of color telling their stories must continue because there are many untold stories in the sphere that need to be heard; and Whereas, These stories need to be heard so that they can help heal the multigenerational hurt that women and women of color have accrued and people will understand better how to heal through racial interactions; Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District is a committed leader in education, embracing all forms of diversity, including supporting the educational achievement of the young women, girls, and youth affected by gender-based discrimination who attend our schools, as expressed by Priorities 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C, and 5C of the 2022-2026 LAUSD Strategic Plan;Whereas, The term young women and girls includes cis and trans women, non-binary and gender nonconforming individuals, impacted by gender-based discrimination;Whereas, According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), teen girls and LGBTQ youth fared worse on most measures of health behaviors and experiences:·	30 percent of girls said they seriously considered attempting suicide, double the rate among boys and up almost 60 percent from a decade ago,·	Almost 20 percent of girls reported experiencing rape or other sexual violence in the previous year, also an increase over previous years,·	Almost half of LGBTQ students said they had seriously considered a suicide attempt.Whereas, According to the same CDC report, the pandemic took a harsh toll on U.S. teen girls’ mental health, with almost 60 percent reporting feelings of persistent sadness or hopelessness;Whereas, Research indicates that social media activity is linked to lower self-esteem and body dysmorphia among teenage girls; andWhereas, Schools play a critical role not just in academic learning, but in creating environments that protect against risk factors and play a critical role in shaping mental, physical, and social growth for young women and girls; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District celebrates the month of March as Women’s History Month, and celebrates March 8th, International Women's Day as a way to honor the movement for women's rights, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women;Resolved, That the District provide more opportunities for our students to learn the stories of women, including in print, radio, TV, stage, screen, blogs, podcasts, news, and social media.Resolved further, That to address disparities and create schools where young women and girls can thrive, the District restates its commitment to the following priorities of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan:1.
