Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice, and as a result announced “Negro History Week” in 1925 to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans; Whereas, It is commonly stated that Carter G. Woodson selected February as the month to host “Negro History Week” because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history, namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, whose birthdays are February 12th and 14th respectively; Whereas, Carter G.
