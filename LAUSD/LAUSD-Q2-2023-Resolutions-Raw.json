    "title": "Standing for Immigrants Seeking Asylum (Res-025-22/23) (Waiver of Board Rule 72)",
    "language": "Whereas, The immigrant community is an integral part of Los Angeles\u2019 diversity, culture, and economy, comprising 33% of its population; Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District proudly welcomed more than 13,000 International Newcomer students in the 2021-2022 school year, providing the supports they need to be successful in school, college, career and life; Whereas, LA Unified\u2019s Strategic Plan has equity as one of its three core beliefs and specifically identifies our immigrant community as a student population for support against bigotry and discrimination; Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to promoting and protecting the rights of all individuals, including migrant families seeking safety and asylum within the United States, and providing them with a welcoming, compassionate, and humane school environment in which to begin rebuilding their lives; Whereas, The Board has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to the safety of its immigrant students, families, and staff at all District sites through past resolutions including \u201cL.A. Unified Identifying Campuses as Safe Zones and Resource Centers for Students and Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement\u201d (Res-032-15/16), \u201cReaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement\u201d (Res-093-16/17), and \u201cSOMOS LAUSD: Declaring Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s Opposition to Migrant Youth Detention Facilities in Our Communities\u201d (Res-027-19/20); Whereas, The Trump administration instituted Title 42 during the COVID\u201319 public health emergency, which eliminated legal pathways for people seeking asylum and allowed authorities to detain and expel migrants at U.S. land borders; the Title 42 policy led to 2.8 million expulsions of individuals and families, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Whereas, Though Title 42 has expired alongside national COVID-19 emergency restrictions, the policy has been replaced by similar, equally harmful restrictions that violate the temporary protected status of migrant asylum seekers and their right to due process; Whereas, Those policies, including the \u201cCircumvention of Lawful Pathways,\u201d which turns away anyone seeking asylum who has not first been denied protection in a country they traveled through; who has not secured advanced permission to enter the U.S.; or who did not apply online for a port of entry appointment; exceptions so narrow as to amount to an asylum ban, leading to the continued violation of human rights while failing to address the underlying causes of migration; and Whereas, The Board recognizes that the detention of migrants, including children and families, has long-lasting detrimental effects on their physical and mental well-being, exacerbating trauma and compromising their rights and dignity; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District remains firm in its commitment to create a welcoming and safe educational environment for migrant asylum seekers and their families and will continue leveraging programs such as the We are One campaign to provide them with the necessary support and resources to help them acclimate to their lives in the United States of America; Resolved further, that the Board reaffirms its commitment to support all our Newcomer students and immigrant families, working to ensure that we are offering high-quality educational opportunities, socio-emotional and wraparound supports to all students regardless of immigration status; Resolved further, That the Board condemns current federal policies regarding migrant asylum, specifically its rule on \u201cCircumvention of Lawful Pathways\u201d that replicates Trump-era asylum rules and denies asylum seekers a fair and legal process to seek refuge in the United States; Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its opposition to the use of migrant detention centers in any form, urging federal agencies to swiftly transition away from their use and avoid their re-creation by any other name, instead prioritizing alternatives to detention that uphold human rights, protect the well-being of migrants, and provide fair, efficient, and safe immigration processes; Resolved further, That the Board will continue supporting its immigrant population by partnering with UCLA's Immigrant Family Legal Clinic housed at the Robert F Kennedy Community of Schools, sharing resources with current and future LAUSD students and families, and further publicizing its online resources on the District homepage to ensure all our migrant families have access to this information as well as integrating these resources in the LAUSD Family Academy during the 2023-24 school year and providing this crucial information to school-based staff, including parent representatives; Resolved further, That the District will continue to support and partner with programs such as Represent LA (formerly the LA Justice Fund), the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the ACLU of Southern California, along with others at the City and County levels to fund legal services for immigrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers, and to the extent permissible by law, prohibit local resources, property, or personnel from being used for federal immigration enforcement; and, be it finally, Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent, the Office of Government Affairs, and the General Counsel to advocate on its behalf (1) for the federal government to end the harmful and illegal asylum ban and instead adopt a comprehensive and compassionate approach to immigration, (2) for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for all immigrants, and (3) for continued support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as it faces challenges in the courts.",

    "language": "Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District serves the largest community of Armenian Americans in the United States, and meaningful and comprehensive data on the Armenian population of Los Angeles, California is currently lacking; Whereas, Armenian American students, and other student populations, continue to be invisible and underserved within U.S. public schools as immigrants, refugees and English Language Learners; Whereas, The federal Office of Management and Budget recently released a new draft questionnaire for the 2030 Census that includes a new Middle East and North African (MENA) category with subcategories such as Lebanese, Syrian, Iranian, and other populations that are currently classified under the White Census category, and are therefore minimized as a distinct population;Whereas, the new draft questionnaire combines race and ethnicity into one category that along with a new MENA category includes a category for \u201cHispanic or Latino\u201d as a \u201crace or ethnicity\u201d instead of the current questionnaire\u2019s separation of race and ethnicity which limits people who identify as Latina/o/x/e or Hispanic; Whereas, Armenian Americans constitute a transnational group across MENA and are historically one of the largest and most impacted groups of immigrants in the U.S. from the MENA region; Whereas, Armenian Americans overwhelmingly support Census classification for their community and have been pushing for the inclusion of an Armenian checkbox in the U.S. Census questionnaire for many decades; and Whereas, The inclusion of the MENA category and a specific Armenian checkbox within the MENA category of the 2030 Census would provide the District with more accurate data on all of its students, which would ultimately bring more educational resources and funding for the District to support underserved student populations; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District fully supports the inclusion of the MENA category in the 2030 Census, and the inclusion of a specific Armenian checkbox as a MENA subcategory, and urges the United States Office of Management and Budget to adopt this recommendation; Resolved further, That the District expresses its support for the efforts of the Armenian National Committee of America Western Region, Armenian American Action Network and other organizations that are advocating for the inclusion of the MENA category and an Armenian checkbox in the 2030 U.S. Census; and, be it finallyResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to send a letter to the Office of Management and Budget expressing the District\u2019s  support for the inclusion of an Armenian checkbox under the proposed MENA category in the 2030 Census and explaining the importance of this inclusion for the Armenian American Students of LAUSD, along with support for the inclusion of the \u201cHispanic or Latino\u201d category.",
