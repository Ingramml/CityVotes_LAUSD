Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Four Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of four projects essential for replacing and upgrading critical systems and components of school buildings, as detailed in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a combined budget of $25,320,917.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve four projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed projects is $25,320,917.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes a project to replace arcades and paving at Hillcrest Elementary School, a project to replace gym bleachers at Hollywood High School, a project to provide a new accessible play structure and greening improvements at Halldale Elementary School, and a project to upgrade the synthetic track, scoreboard, and tennis courts at Nathaniel Narbonne High School.
 
The project at Halldale Elementary School was awarded a grant from the Community Project Funding (CPF) program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Under the CPF program, Members of Congress select specific projects in their communities for funding which is approved as part of the annual appropriations process. Representative Nanette Barragán, an alumna of Halldale Elementary School representing California’s 44th Congressional District, designated CPF funding in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill for the new accessible play structure and greening improvements project. This CPF grant is a cost-reimbursement award which requires initial funding to be provided and then allows documented costs to be fully reimbursed up to the project budget of $2,500,000.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve four projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the four proposed projects is $25,320,917 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. Staff anticipates reimbursement of up to $2,500,000 in CPF grant funds for the proposed project at Halldale Elementary School.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 3,800 current and future students attending these four schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve the Lemay Street Early Education Center Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a project to provide an outdoor classroom and campus upgrades at Lemay Street Early Education Center (BD 3 Region N), and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a budget of $8,544,763.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the Lemay Street Early Education Center (BD 3 Region N) Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The budget for the proposed project is $8,544,763.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Project will create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classroom may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging
•                     Building materials
 
The proposed Project will provide an outdoor classroom by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. Campus upgrades include new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, roofing, irrigation system, exterior painting of the Children’s Center Building, necessary upgrades to the fire alarm system and utilities, and interim facilities to support school programs during construction. Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility upgrades include accessible path of travel, parking area, doors and signage, and a children’s restroom. The scope of work also includes any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state, and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2028.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Project. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, access to nature-based green space will remain limited, and early education facilities needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the Project is $8,544,763 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
The Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the Project.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning, as well as address early education facilities needs that are necessary to improve student health, safety, and educational quality to benefit approximately 115 students at Lemay Street Early Education Center (Board District 3, Region North).
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor spaces will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
 
Equity Impact:
The proposed Project was identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with the Region and school site administrator. The site was selected based upon the center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Project’s proposal in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Project’s scope will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Project’s scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
description
(Approve an Amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Redefine the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project) Recommends approval of an amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to redefine the Bell High School (BD5, Region East) Classroom Replacement Project with a revised budget of $197,435,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve an amendment to the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to redefine the Bell High School (BD5, Region East) Classroom Replacement Project as described in Exhibit A. The budget for the redefined project is $197,435,000, an increase of $73,450,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the redefined project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Staff initially considered proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings. However, in an effort to maximize efficiencies and expedite the HVAC replacement, Staff recommends that the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project be redefined to include the replacement and upgrade of the existing HVAC systems. Coordinating and performing the proposed replacement and upgrade of the HVAC system in the Main Building, Locker & Shower Building, and Sanitary Buildings concurrently with the planned work of the Classroom Replacement project will streamline design and construction efforts and eliminate any potential duplicative work that may occur with two separate projects and general contractors.
 
The proposed redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project includes the following added scope:
 
•                     Replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, exhaust fans, and miscellaneous ductwork at the Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields.
 
•                     Installation of a new Energy Management System (EMS) for all permanent and relocatable buildings that will remain after completion of this project.
 
•                     Installation and removal of interim facilities including approximately 30 classrooms, 2 administrative spaces, and 2 restrooms necessary to support school programs during construction.
 
•                     Construction of new tennis courts and a new softball field as well as restoration of parking and landscaping where interim facilities and existing relocatable buildings are to be removed.
 
The prior scope approved in the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project included the removal of 10 existing relocatable buildings and 3 permanent buildings assuming that a standalone HVAC project would remove an additional 5 existing relocatable buildings and 1 permanent building. The redefined project includes the removal of all 15 existing relocatable buildings and 4 permanent buildings.  The prior definition also included some interim facilities; however, this has been expanded in the redefined project to expedite the replacement of classrooms and HVAC together. The complete scope, budget, and schedule for the redefined project is provided in Exhibit A.
 
Staff anticipates that construction activities will begin in the 3rd quarter of 2027. The activities for site/utilities/interim facilities may begin in advance of this work in an earlier phase. Construction is anticipated to be completed by the 4th quarter of 2031.
 
Bell High School is located in Region East and Board District 5 (Karla Griego).
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included herein as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified School District’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to redefine the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the design and construction of the redefined project.
 
The new facilities, once completed, will provide facilities that support education programs and student achievement. The redefined project will also decrease demand for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds for environmental reviews and clearances, design, procurement, construction, and other activities necessary to implement the redefined project.
 
If the proposal is not approved, the project will not be redefined, and the school will not benefit from the additional critical replacements and associated campus upgrades being proposed.
 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. The proposal is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in the District's local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by replacing existing relocatable buildings with new permanent buildings and providing critical replacements and upgrades.
 
Budget Impact: 
The redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project increases the project budget by $73,450,000, which results in an updated project budget of $197,435,000.  This budget reflects current information known, and assumptions about the project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the project.
 
The redefined project, including the new HVAC scope, is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.  This action will require the transfer of $73,450,000 from the SUP category of need for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components to the SUP category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.
 
Student Impact:
The redefined Bell High School Classroom Replacement project, once completed, will help ensure approximately 2,100 students attending this school are provided with safe, welcoming, and state-of-the-art learning environments that support student-centered and engaged learning.  The redefined project will also ensure the students attending Bell High School are provided with updated facilities that are well-ventilated with efficient heating and air conditioning systems that support learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Bell High School was prioritized for a classroom replacement project based on 1) the number of relocatable buildings that are not certified by the Division of the State Architect and 2) the number of students served.  The new HVAC scope was prioritized according to the critical replacement criteria of first addressing the building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Redefining the Classroom Replacement project instead of proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings will enable staff to better coordinate design and construction efforts, maximize budget efficiencies, and minimize impacts on the learning environment.

Body
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework. The updated SUP framework and the Measure RR Implementation Plan help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. 
 
Pursuant to the Board Resolution, Modernization, Upgrade and Development of High School Athletic Facilities, adopted on June 22, 2021, funding has been prioritized within the SUP to modernize, upgrade, or develop new high school athletic facilities within each Board District.  Projects to upgrade high school athletic facilities within each Board District fall under the SUP category of need for School Upgrades and Reconfigurations to Support Wellness, Health, Athletics, Learning, and Efficiency.  Funds are allocated for each Board District based on each Board District’s proportionate share of high school enrollment and number of sports teams.  Proposed Project is identified by Board offices in consultation with stakeholders and developed by Facilities staff.
 
The Project includes, but is not limited to:
•                     The design and construction of a new baseball field scoreboard with connection to existing electrical panel.
 
 
•                     Requirements from the Division of the State Architect (DSA), California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), or other improvements to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations.
 
Construction is anticipated to begin in Q4-2025 and be completed in Q2-2026.  The proposed Project will support the school’s physical education and athletic programs and allow the school to practice for and/or host athletic events which contribute to student athletic achievement, school pride, and a positive school culture.
 
The proposed Project is in Board District 6 (Kelly Gonez) and Region North.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve the proposed Project and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project and expenditure of Bond Program funds.
 
The proposed Project, once completed, will support physical education programs, student athletic achievement, and athletic programs.  The proposed Project will also decrease demand for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Project in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. 
 
If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and the school will continue to operate without a new baseball scoreboard.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. The proposal supports the implementation of the Modernization, Upgrade and Development of High School Athletic Facilities Board Resolution.  The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading athletic facilities at school.
 
Budget Impact: 
The proposed Project budget is $556,683 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency, and more specifically from the amount allocated for upgrades to athletic facilities in Board District 6.
 
The Project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions.  The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed Project, once completed, will provide a new baseball scoreboard that supports physical education programs, student athletic achievement, and athletic programs to benefit approximately 1,200 students.  The new baseball scoreboard will also allow the school to practice for and/or host games and other school community events, which builds school pride and enhances opportunities to create a positive school culture.
 
Equity Impact:
Funds are allocated for the Board District based on a proportionate share of high school enrollment and number of sports teams.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Staff will implement all opportunities to minimize construction impacts on school operations and existing athletic programs. As necessary, the temporary use of local parks, neighboring school athletic facilities, and other opportunities will be utilized to reduce impacts to the existing athletic programs at each school. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

description
(Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Filing of Applications for State Allocation Board-Administered Programs and Acknowledging Requirement to Submit Five-Year School Facilities Master Plan) Recommends adoption of a resolution to authorize Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or District) to file applications for State Allocation Board-administered programs and acknowledges, as a condition of participation in the School Facility Program, the requirement to submit a five-year school facilities master plan to the California Department of General Services, Office of Public School Construction.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adoption of the attached Board of Education resolution (Exhibit A), which authorizes LAUSD personnel to file applications for State Allocation Board-administered programs and acknowledges, as a condition of participation in the School Facility Program, the requirement to submit a five-year school facilities master plan to the California Department of General Services, Office of Public School Construction.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The State Allocation Board (SAB) is responsible for determining the allocation of state resources used to fund the new construction and modernization of public-school facilities through the School Facility Program (SFP). These funding resources come from voter-approved general obligation bond funds and other designated state funds, which are allocated into various SFP programs. LAUSD has applied for grants through these programs and has been awarded approximately $5.61 billion so far, allowing the District to build new schools, modernize existing campuses, and provide learning environments that help students achieve educational goals.
 
As a result of the passage of the Kindergarten through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024 (Proposition 2), each school district that intends to participate in the SFP must submit to the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) a five-year school facilities master plan, or an updated five-year school facilities master plan, approved by the district’s governing board. The specific elements required in the master plan, and the standards for master-plan preparation, are expected to be determined by the SAB sometime during the first half of 2025. Until the master plan is completed, a district may continue to submit SFP grant applications, provided that it submits to OPSC a resolution, approved by the district’s governing board, acknowledging the master-plan requirement, and provided that the district complies with the deadlines specified in the resolution. The attached resolution will allow LAUSD to continue filing grant applications during this period.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Adoption of the attached resolution so that LAUSD may continue filing SFP grant applications until a five-year facilities master plan can be submitted to OPSC.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this resolution will allow LAUSD to continue filing SFP grant applications without interruption.
 
Disapproval of the resolution will require LAUSD to suspend all SFP grant applications until LAUSD fulfills the five-year facilities master plan requirement. Grant applications (other than Facility Hardship and Seismic Mitigation program applications) are processed and awarded in the order in which OPSC receives them. Because of the large backlog of applications, any delay in submission of the District’s applications increases the likelihood that, even with the funds recently made available under Proposition 2, funding will be exhausted by the time these applications are processed. Therefore, disapproval of this resolution could jeopardize LAUSD’s ability to receive some SFP grants.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal advances Pillar 2 (Joy and Wellness) and Pillar 4 (Operational Effectiveness) of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by facilitating the funding of school construction projects, thus providing facilities that improve students’ access to safe, healthy, and educationally effective learning environments.
 
Budget Impact: 
SFP funding of school construction projects reduces the burden on local sources of school funding.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this resolution will allow the District to continue applying for SFP grants for the construction of modern school facilities, thus improving students’ access to a safe and healthy learning environment.
 
Equity Impact:
Grants awarded through the SFP support the District’s Bond program, which is focused on improving equity between newer and older schools so that all students have an equal opportunity for success.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 7 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 7 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit. Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new multiple subject, English, and special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as multiple subject, English, and special education where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at this Board Meeting for approval of a non-routine personnel action.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action:
 
A “Yes” vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Association, Service Employees International Union, Local 99, California School Employees Association, Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeal.
 
A “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable.
 
Budget Impact: 
No budget impact
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:

Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact: 
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up-to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Brief Description:
description
Recommends approval of the 15 named and prior provisionally approved, members of the Integrated Pest Management Team.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
The Board of Education (“Board”) is asked to approve the appointment of 15 named and prior provisionally approved individuals to the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”). 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”; see Attachment A).  The Team serves to provide guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property and the environment. 
 
The District operates its pest control activities within the framework of the Policy, which itself conforms to the standards of the Healthy Schools Act (“HSA”).  Furthermore, the Policy articulates terms and guidelines by which the Team must act, and specifies how Team membership is to be constituted.
 
On June 29, 2022, an audit by the LAUSD Office of Inspector General (see Attachment B) concluded that the Integrated Pest Management program was largely compliant with the Policy and the HSA.  However, the audit identified procedural issues, notably: (1) the lack of an effective training program for stakeholders; (2) the need for a document review process to ensure HSA compliance; and (3) the need to realign Team appointments and recruitment with the Policy.
 
Since 2010, neither the Board nor any of its committees have approved Team members to serve their designated terms.  As a result, none of the currently participating individuals have been formally appointed to the Team.
 
On November 15, 2022, the Board authorized the formation of an Integrated Pest Management Ad Hoc Committee, tasked with re-constituting the Team by provisionally approving then-existing Team participants.  The Team was re-constituted with those participants as well as two additional individuals who had been initially vetted.
 
On August 27, 2024, the Integrated Pest Management Ad Hoc Committee met, approved and appointed all individuals to a provisional sixty day term, which was subsequently extended for an additional sixty days by the Board.
 
In the interim, the Board Secretariat has worked with the provisionally appointed individuals to reconfirm their commitments to serve on the Team, and collect their resumes and Certification Of Confidentiality & No Financial Interests forms.  Materials for all individuals who currently intend to proceed with full term appointments to the Team are attached hereto as Attachment C.  All remaining vacant positions will be presented for approval to the Board or one of its committees at a later date.  
 
This report incorporates by reference Board Report No. 107-22/23 (Integrated Pest Management Referral), which was adopted by the Board on November 15, 2023.  Moving forward, Team members will serve and complete their tenures in accordance with the Policy.  In the absence of the Board’s approval of future Team members, membership approval will be presented to a Board committee or the Committee of the Whole, as deemed by the Board Secretariat. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the 15 named and prior provisionally approved individuals to the Team, in alignment with the Policy.  The Team and all of its members will proceed consistent with the terms of the Policy. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges, and the Team’s membership will not be constituted in a manner consistent with the Policy. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Positive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Three Campus Reconstruction Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of three Campus Reconstruction projects, as described in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a combined budget of $604,205,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve three Campus Reconstruction Projects (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $604,205,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
In early January 2025, Los Angeles County experienced historic and catastrophic losses due to severe windstorms and multiple wildfires that devastated many cherished communities. For the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD, Los Angeles Unified, or the District), the Palisades Fire caused an unprecedented loss of facilities due to fire damage with significant impacts to Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School. The recommended scope, schedule, and budget for the design and reconstruction of these campuses has been developed to expedite the repopulation of the affected schools as a critical step in the recovery of the Pacific Palisades community.
 
On January 14, 2025, the Board of Education (Board) adopted a resolution declaring emergency conditions as a result of the severe windstorms and fire conditions (Emergency Conditions Resolution). This Board action also authorized the execution of emergency contracts through June 30, 2025, to address these emergency conditions and help ensure the continuation of public education, the health and safety of District students and staff, and the repair and restoration of District property. The Facilities Services Division created emergency projects in response to this resolution to begin preliminary site clearance and remediation at the three schools significantly impacted by the Palisades Fire.
 
The Campus Reconstruction Projects proposed in this action will restore and rebuild the Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School campuses. Marquez Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School includes two phases: Phase 1 provides interim facilities and site restoration to provide students with the opportunity to return to their campuses and Phase 2 provides permanent construction with new buildings and facilities for each campus, as detailed in Exhibit A. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed, as detailed in Exhibit A.  
 
The Campus Reconstruction Projects will be implemented under the School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - which was updated by Board actions in 2021 and 2024 to integrate Measures RR and US funds into categories of need that represent goals guiding project development. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School will be funded by the category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses while the proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School will be funded by the category of need for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions. Projects developed under both of these categories of need are included in the Facilities SEP. Although the Projects will be funded by local bonds, external funding sources are being sought as reimbursement to the Bond Program as well as to the emergency projects; these sources could include funding from insurance proceeds, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the State of California School Facilities Program.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to provide facilities that promote student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and the campus reconstruction efforts will not move forward.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing new facilities that are urgently needed due to the devastating Palisades Fire.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $604,205,000. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School, with a combined budget of $337,584,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. The proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School, with a budget of $266,621,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
LAUSD is pursuing additional funding from numerous external sources including insurance claims, FEMA, and the State of California School Facilities Program. Staff does not yet know the amount or timing of receipt of funds from any of these potential sources, some of which may be available only as reimbursement. Depending on the timing, any external funding received for these projects would be used in lieu of, or as reimbursement to, bond funds. Even after receiving potential external funding, it is anticipated that some portion of funding from the Bond Program will be required to complete the proposed Projects. Additionally, any bond eligible costs that have been incurred on the emergency projects will be transferred to the Campus Reconstruction Projects.  
 
Each Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to provide facilities that help ensure the approximately 3,620 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
These Projects replace facilities at Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School that were impacted by the Palisades Fire. Permanent facilities will be constructed to serve the student enrollment at each school prior to the Palisades Fire.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
LAUSD is committed to restoring these three school communities by providing facilities that allow for the expeditious repopulation of each campus. Initially, interim facilities will be placed to provide students with the opportunity to return to Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed. Thereafter, the District will design and construct permanent replacement facilities to fully restore the operations of each school.
 
Facilities assessments, environmental remediation efforts, planning and design efforts, interim facilities procurement and installation, and other activities that were immediately necessary in response to the Palisades Fire are currently underway as part of the emergency projects created in response to the Emergency Conditions Resolution. The proposed Campus Reconstruction Projects will meet the District’s commitment to a prompt reopening of these schools.
 
It may be necessary to undertake additional feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedules, and budgets will be revised accordingly.

Body
Background: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution, which is a resolution that authorizes the issuance of up to $1,000,000,000of GO Bonds under Measure Q, Measure RR, Measure US or any combination of the foregoing to finance projects authorized under the respective measure and the form of documents necessary to issue the GO Bonds. The General Obligation Bonds Resolution authorizes the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Deputy Controller to affect the issuance of the GO Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions. In addition, consistent with the District’s practice for prior GO Bonds, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution provides for a request to the Board of Supervisors of the County to adopt a corresponding resolution providing for the issuance of the GO Bonds pursuant to the Education Code. The GO Bonds are currently expected to be sold in Fall 2025.
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, as determined by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution also authorizes the sale of the GO bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility provided, and the ability to include a retail order period and provide meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. Finance, in accordance with the procedures established in the Debt Management Policy, has completed the process of selecting certain members of the financing team from the respective legal counsel and municipal advisor benches. The financing team for the upcoming transaction will include Dannis Woliver Kelley as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel and Public Resources Advisory Group, as Municipal Advisor. In addition, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association will serve as Paying Agent. The Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager(s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1 and Education Code Section 15146, the Board of Education has obtained from Public Resources Advisory Group, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution.
The GO Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law and as authorized by voters within the District pursuant to Measure Q, Measure RR, and Measure US.
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the issuance of the General Obligation Bonds will enable the District to enter the market to finance approved capital projects.
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of GO Bonds to finance approved capital projects.
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and Article 4 Section 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
Budget Impact: 
There will be no material impact on the District’s General Fund. The identified projects will be funded with bond proceeds, and debt service will be repaid by ad valorem property tax revenues, not the District’s general fund revenues.
Student Impact:
The issuance of the General Obligation Bonds will improve the District’s capital facilities and information technology resources for the benefit of the students.

Body
Background: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the Master Refunding Resolution, which is a master resolution for the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds in an amount not-to-exceed $5.1 billion through Fiscal Year 2025-26. The purpose of the Master Refunding Resolution is to enable the District to quickly take advantage of favorable market conditions if they arise, and to reduce tax-payers’ debt service costs through economic refundings. The District has periodically used this approach in the past to authorize its general obligation refunding bonds. The Master Refunding Resolution authorizes the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Deputy Controller to effect the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions. 
While the District typically issues refunding bonds on a tax-exempt basis, it is possible that either tax-exempt or taxable refunding structures may generate significant savings to justify an economic refunding. As a result, the Master Refunding Resolution provides the flexibility to issue the GO Refunding Bonds on either a tax-exempt or taxable basis if circumstances arise that favor one or the other structure. The Master Refunding Resolution also authorizes the forms of documents necessary to issue the GO Refunding Bonds. 
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, the Master Refunding Resolution authorizes the sale of the GO Refunding Bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility, and the ability to include a retail order period and meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. If refunding opportunities arise, the Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager(s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.  Alternatively, the Master Refunding Resolution provides flexibility to issue the GO Refunding Bonds via competitive sale if favorable market conditions arise.
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1, the Board of Education has obtained from KNN Public Finance, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the Master Refunding Resolution. 
The GO Refunding Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law. 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the Master Refunding Resolution will enable the District to enter the market in an expedited manner to reduce the debt service costs on a portion of the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds should market conditions support one or more refundings.
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds which, subject to favorable market conditions, may generate taxpayer savings through a refunding. 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and Article 4 Sections 4.08 and 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy. 
Budget Impact: 
The proceeds of the GO Refunding Bonds will be placed into an escrow account and used to defease and call (prepay) the refunded bonds. Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. There will be no impact on the District’s General Fund.
 
Student Impact:
The issuance of GO Refunding Bonds will reduce the taxes needed to repay the debt service on the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds and create more capacity to issue general obligation bonds in the future for new projects.
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

     3

Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. Communities that have experienced historical inequities should benefit from reduced property taxes.



Resource Prioritization

     4

Savings achieved through the refunding of outstanding bonds benefit the District and its taxpayers through reduced debt service and property tax levies, respectively. This relief allows resources that would otherwise be used to service debt and property taxes, to be used for student needs.  



Results

     2

The refunding of bonds is done to achieve debt service savings and reduce ad valorem property taxes. It may result in closing achievement gaps by increasing disposable income in households located within communities that have experienced historical inequities, giving them the ability to allocate resources towards the education of their children (students).

Annually, the Local Plan’s Section D: Annual Budget Plan and Section E: Annual Service Plan must be completed, reviewed, and approved by the Local Education Agency (LEA) and submitted to the California Department of Education (CDE). Every three years, all sections (A-E) of the SELPA Local Plan must be revised. The last Board adoption of the annual SELPA Local Plan occurred in June 2024. 
 
Section A of the Local Plan “Contacts and Certifications” provides a description of the local planning process and governance structure used to ensure that special education services are delivered in compliance with state and federal laws. special education services.  
 
Section B of the SELPA focuses on governance and administration. It outlines the organizational structure, responsibilities, and procedures for governing the SELPA and implementing special education services within the region. This section may include details about the SELPA's governing board, advisory committees, decision-making processes, budget allocations, and administrative procedures for managing programs and resources. It serves as a blueprint for how the SELPA operates and ensures accountability and transparency in its administration of special education services. 
 
The Annual Budget Plan Section D projects special education revenues and expenditures. State (AB602) and Federal IDEA revenue projections are based on funding formulas that rely on student counts. The projected expenditure distribution is based on a districtwide analysis of all required Individualized Education Program (IEP) services, including low incidence and mental health services. 
 
The Annual Services Plan Section E describes the services to be provided by the Local Education Agency (LEA). 
 
The Community Advisory Committee (CAC) advised the policy and administrative agency during the development of the Local Plan, in accordance with California Education Code (EC) Section 56194. The Division of Special Education developed a Google Form to collect input from CAC members during the 30-day public review period, pursuant to California Education Code Sections 56194 (a) and (b); and 56205(a)(12)(E) and (b)(7).

end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility within eight years through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
Under the Transition Plan, each school is assigned to one of three levels of accessibility (Category One, Two, or Three) based on assessments of more than two dozen criteria including school programs, matriculation options, feeder pattern, geographic location, known (or anticipated/matriculating) population of students with disabilities or parents/guardians with disabilities, type of instructional model, and public input. The assigned category reflects the level of accessibility the site needs to meet. Schools that do not yet meet the criteria for their assigned category will undergo accessibility improvements and are prioritized for project development based on the criteria mentioned above. The three categories of accessibility are as follows: 
 
 
₋                     Category One: These are “key” schools and will have the highest level of access, generally in accordance with applicable physical accessibility standards. Category 1A will provide “full accessibility” for the schools that were built to new construction standards, while Category 1B will provide “high accessibility” for schools that have been altered with some limited exceptions.
 
₋                     Category Two: These will be “program-accessible” schools. The core spaces and features of these schools would be made accessible; in addition, program accessibility would be provided to all programs and activities at the school. 
 
₋                     Category Three: These schools will have “core access,” which means that the core spaces (certain common spaces) would be made accessible, to ensure a basic level of access to the building. These include, for example, parking, the main entrance and main office, assembly areas, and some restrooms.
 
The five school sites for which an accessibility enhancement project is being proposed do not yet meet their assigned category/level of accessibility and thus require facilities improvements. The scope, schedule, and budget for each proposed project reflects the existing known conditions at each school site and the improvements necessary to meet each school’s assigned category of accessibility. The conditions of significance include acreage, topography, square footage, existence of multi-story buildings, age of buildings, as well as the number of schools, programs, features, and activities at a school site. 
 
A need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access classroom buildings at Cheremoya  ES and Ritter ES has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student’s need for programmatic access. These projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed “rapidly” with a project budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed barrier removal projects at Cheremoya ES and Ritter ES do not meet the parameters of the RAP due to their scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the project proposals to the Board for approval.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit D. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit E. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve five accessibility enhancement projects and two barrier removal projects, as detailed in Exhibits A and B, and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately begin designing the proposed projects at seven school sites.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the five proposed accessibility enhancement projects, which are necessary to achieve program accessibility as outlined in the Transition Plan, and the two barrier removal projects, which are required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal furthers the implementation of the Transition Plan. As outlined in the Transition Plan, at Category One, Two and Three schools, an appropriate number of classrooms will be identified to serve as accessible learning spaces, some of which may require facility improvements to meet the criteria for their assigned accessibility category. Additionally, the proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements at schools.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves. This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget, as currently estimated, for the seven proposed projects is $43,447,077. The proposed projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
The seven proposed projects will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 3,600 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at each campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability. As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible. While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities. These proposed projects are in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.
 
Cheremoya ES and Ritter ES have been assigned a Category Two accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing more robust scopes that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that providing three path of travel upgrades, one concrete ramp, one accessible gate, and two intercoms at Cheremoya ES and providing one path of travel upgrade, one restroom upgrade, one concrete ramp, three door hardware, two intercoms, and two miscellaneous upgrades at Ritter ES would provide students and staff direct access to the classroom buildings. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Five Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends the definition and approval of five Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan, for a combined budget of $700,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve five SEEDS Projects at Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School, Mulholland Middle School, Stoner Avenue Elementary School, Toland Way Elementary School, and Warner Elementary School (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive, Chief Procurement Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed SEEDS Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The SEEDS Program supports the development of projects that will enhance school sites by creating outdoor learning spaces in collaboration with school-based and community-led efforts (Program). There are two components to the Program:
 
1.                     Development of the outdoor learning space constructed by Los Angeles Unified includes capital investments, such as asphalt removal, installation of irrigation and utilities, and any associated testing and inspection.
 
2.                     Collaboration with a school site and/or partner organization that will outfit the outdoor learning space with the plant materials and landscaping features that align with the school’s instructional vision and program. This component is essential to the success of each project.
 
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school site by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit a SEEDS application to receive up to $100,000 to create or improve an outdoor learning space. An additional $50,000 is available to schools ranked in the top 150 on the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index of schools in need of green space as published in August 2022 (Greening Index).
 
The Greening Index ranks the five schools as follows: Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School (619), Mulholland Middle School (577), Stoner Avenue Elementary School (91), Toland Way Elementary School (336), and Warner Elementary School (144). Therefore, Stoner Avenue Elementary School and Warner Elementary School are eligible for the additional $50,000 allocation.
 
District staff evaluates the proposals based on the specific criteria and requirements outlined in the SEEDS Program Guide to ensure each proposal meets the eligibility requirements. Proposals must include a written project narrative describing the project scope, an explanation of how the project will be integrated into the school’s curriculum, and confirmation of the availability of resources to outfit and maintain the outdoor learning space. The recommended Projects included in this Board Report have been reviewed and have been found to comply with the program requirements, including feasibility and equitable distribution throughout the District.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this proposed action will enable staff to proceed with the design and construction of these five proposed Projects. Approval of these greening Projects will improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff, increase sustainability, and enhance the outdoor school environment.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to execute these proposed Projects that support educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science. If these proposed projects are not approved, the school sites will not benefit from the creation of these outdoor learning spaces.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The action is also aligned with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 2 Joy and Wellness Welcoming Learning Environments by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined project budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000. The Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
The combined project budget includes a contribution of $100,000 from Bond Program funds earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 4. This contribution will be transferred to funds earmarked in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency. The breakdown of this contribution by project is shown in Exhibit A.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed SEEDS projects at Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School, Mulholland Middle School, Stoner Avenue Elementary School, Toland Way Elementary School, and Warner Elementary School will provide outdoor learning spaces that create environments for student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. These SEEDS learning gardens will facilitate educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science, and may also be used during recess and lunchtime by approximately 2,510 current and future students. These proposed Projects also encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces.
 
Equity Impact:
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit an application for a SEEDS project for up to $100,000. Schools ranked in the top 150 on the Greening Index will receive an additional $50,000 for their SEEDS project. Two of the five proposed projects included in this Board Report qualify for this additional funding.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In order to ensure the long-term permanence of each SEEDS project, the school site and/or its partner organization must enter into a Maintenance Agreement that provides for the ongoing maintenance of the proposed outdoor learning space.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Birmingham Community Charter High School Aquatic Facility Replacement Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a project to replace the outdoor swimming pool complex at Birmingham Community Charter High School (Board District 3), and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a budget of $41,141,552.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the Birmingham Community Charter High School Aquatic Facility Replacement Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein.  The budget of the proposed Project is $41,141,552.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - supports the development of projects that upgrade, modernize, and replace aging and deteriorating school facilities, update technology, and address facilities inequities to help improve student health, safety, and educational quality.  The SUP includes a spending target entitled, “Charter School Facilities Upgrades and Expansions.”  Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP.
 
Charter school facilities upgrade projects developed under this category of need are subject to assessment of the conditions and needs of the school building/site systems and components of District facilities occupied by charter schools, input from the charter school community, and development of an implementation plan by District staff.  
 
The swimming pool complex at Birmingham Community Charter High School is in need of replacement due to continuous leakage from cracks found throughout the swimming pool and the pool deck, causing reduced water levels in the swimming pool and saturated soil behind the perimeter walls of the swimming pool complex.
 
The scope of the proposed Project includes, but is not limited to, the following:
 
•                     Construction of new outdoor swimming pool and associated support buildings as well as new shade structures, scoreboard, accessible bleachers, and sports lighting system with audio/visual system.
 
•                     Demolition of existing outdoor swimming pool complex, including support buildings and structures.
 
•                     Site improvements at former pool area, including new natural turf, landscaping, and irrigation. 
 
•                     Compliance with requirements from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Division of the State Architect (DSA), California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), or other obligations to ensure adherence with local, state, and federal requirements.
 
Construction is anticipated to begin in Q4-2027 and be completed in Q4-2029. The proposed Project will enhance physical education and athletics at Birmingham Community Charter High School and Daniel Pearl Magnet School - whose students participate in the aquatics program - and support California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) competitions for multiple West Valley schools including Taft Charter HS, Kennedy HS, Van Nuys HS, Granada Hills Charter, and El Camino Real Charter HS at the area’s only pool. The proposed Project contributes to student health, safety, athletic achievement, school pride, and a positive school culture.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A.  The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B.  Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.
 
The proposed Project, once completed, will support student athletic achievement and physical education programs. The proposed Project will also decrease demand for ongoing costly repairs and maintenance, ensure compliance with current codes and requirements of the CIF for competition pools, and improve student health and safety.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Project in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US.  If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and ongoing repair and maintenance costs to operate the pool will continue until it is no longer deemed usable.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy.  The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures.  The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading athletic facilities. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the proposed Project is $41,141,552, and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
The budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions.  The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Project enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to improve facilities that help ensure thousands of current and future students are provided a safe environment that promotes physical education programs and student athletic achievement.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff will implement all opportunities to minimize construction impacts on school operations and existing athletic programs. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with CEQA.

(Approval of the renaming of Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter) Recommends approval of renaming the school to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renaming of Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy consistent with BUL-5549.2 (Naming/ Renaming Schools, Buildings, and Fields). The school is located in Board District 4, Region North. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
In the Fall of 2024, the community of Reseda raised concerns with the current name of the school: Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter. School administrators and staff began to communicate with stakeholders about the possible formation of a renaming committee made up of students, staff, and teachers. In the Fall of 2024, the renaming committee began to have formal meetings and generated feedback and ideas for school names from different stakeholders.
 
The school community proposed a name change would avoid confusion of being considered as an independent charter school. New families have shared the word “charter” in the school’s name automatically causes families to assume that Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter is not part of the LAUSD district. This confusion has led families away from the school thinking that the school is not aligned with the guidelines and policies of the school district. 
 
The renaming committee proposed 2 school names for the community to vote on:  Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter (keep as is) or Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy. 
 
The school community realizes that changing the school’s name will support with attracting new families. The school will continue to successfully operate as a welcoming environment. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
The school and community voted to change the name Hesby Oaks Charter to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy. With the adoption of this report by the Los Angeles Unified Board of Education, Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy will become the new name of the school.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If a “Yes” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name will change to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy.
 
 
If a “No” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name of the school will remain Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter.
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no known budget impact at this time as signage changes are not required. Dropping Charter from the school’s name will not require any new signage, therefore there are no fiscal impacts associated with this board report. 
 
Student Impact:
Renaming the school to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy would have a positive community impact. It was also the most voted name by the parent and student stakeholder group. Stakeholders strongly believe that this will encourage new families to enroll and eliminate the confusion of assuming the school is part of a charter organization. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

description
(Approval of the renaming of Boyle Heights Hida Solis Senior High School) Recommends approval of renaming of the school to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renaming of Boyle Heights Hilda Solis Senior HS to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex consistent with BUL-5549.2 (Naming/Renaming Schools, Buildings, and Fields). The school is located in Board District 2, Region East.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The school originally served the Boyle Heights community where it was co-located on a middle school site. The district decided to relocate the school onto the Hilda L. Solis campus at the end of the 2023-24 school year. The school brings a unique thread of STEM focus for students in the surrounding community. The school may now reach, beyond Boyle Heights and into the Eastside Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.  The proposed Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex reflects growth. There has been an effort to maintain the schools original name while weaving together both schools.  Under the new name the school is prepared to welcome students from a broader service to diverse communities in the greater Eastside Region. Additionally, to honor the Hilda L. Solis Learning Academy (previous campus name) and the fact that the school is part of a larger complex, which includes a learning center, the name was to retain the Hilda L. Solis as part of the name. Due to the Boyle Heights campus relocation; this move has given the school an opportunity to grow the vibrant STEM program. The campus will be a great place to increase enrollment while offering addition A-G courses on site. At the new location, the campus will have an opportunity to expand its robotics program. The renaming committee proposed 3 names: Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex, Jose M. Hernandez High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex and Ruben Salazar at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.   
 
Expected Outcomes:
The school and community voted to change the name Boyle Heights Hilda L. Solis Senior HS magnet to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If a “yes” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name will change to Eastside High School at Hilda Solis Learning Complex. 
 
If a “no” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name of the school will remain Boyle Heights Hilda Solis HS STEM Magnet which does not represent the present community. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no known budget impact at this time as signage changes are not required. Updating the school’s name will not require new signage. There will be no fiscal impact to the changing of the name from Boyle Heights Hilda Solis Senior HS to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
 
Student Impact:
Renaming the school would have a positive community impact. It was also the most voted name by the parent and student stakeholder group. Students feel a strong, positive connection, rather than the current name, which is not inclusive or representative of the present. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

(Approval of Community Advisory Committee (CAC) Membership) Recommends approval of prospective members to serve on the District Community Advisory Committee, as required by the California Education Code, section 56191.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve those persons included in Attachment A for a term of membership on the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) for the identified terms of 2025-2027, and alternates to serve on the CAC for the 2025-2026 school year.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The CAC serves in an advisory capacity to the Board of Education and the Division of Special Education on the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).
 
The California Education Code, Section 56190-56193, requires each SELPA to establish a CAC to fulfill specific responsibilities. In addition, it requires that the members of the CAC be appointed by the Board of Education using selection procedures described in the SELPA Local Plan. CAC members serve a two-year term, which is staggered to ensure that no more than one half of the membership serves the first year of the term in any one year.
 
The CAC must be composed of the following: parents of individuals with exceptional needs enrolled in public or private schools (must serve as committee majority), parents of other students enrolled in school, students and adults with disabilities, regular education teachers, special education teachers, and other school personnel, representatives of other public and private agencies, and people concerned with the needs of individuals with exceptional needs. CAC bylaws also state that “CAC members must live, work, attend, or be the parent/guardian of a student attending a school within the LAUSD SELPA.”
 
For the last decade, prospective members of the CAC were identified through the ranking of applications, with an appointment committee assigning points to applications based on a rubric.  At parents' request last year for a more transparent process, the SELPA Local Plan language changed to allow for membership elections to occur in much the same way they transpire for other state-mandated District central committees identified in the California Education Code.  This year, vacancies for the seats of parents of students with exceptional needs were filled by in-person elections in each Region and online for the Virtual Academies.  The elections for special education students and special education teachers occurred online in the evening. The vacancies for the other categories of adult with disabilities, community members, community-based organizations, and alternate for the seat of parent of general education students were filled at an in-person election in a central location at the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement. 
 
Vacancies for membership on the CAC were advertised on KLCS and District websites; through special education parent trainings and bi-weekly Family Academy webinars; through LAUSD’s Department of Transition Services (DOTS) staff and Region special education teams; and emails, voice, and text messages sent to all Los Angeles Unified families and additionally to parents or guardians of students with exceptional needs. Membership vacancies were also advertised via flyers and announcements during CAC, PAC, and DELAC meetings; at Region Ambassador sessions and various Region workshops; through the Charter Division and the Office of Development and Civic Engagement; and sent directly to each Board of Education staff via email for distribution. The Division of Special Education and the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement held 11 elections during April and one additional election in the month of May. The proposed persons being submitted for appointment to the CAC were elected by their peers, as required by the California Education Code. 
 
According to the California Education Code, Section 56194, the CAC addresses the responsibilities defined in the local plan as described below, including, but not limited to, all the following:
 
a.                     Advising the policy and administrative entity of the special education local plan area regarding
 the development, amendment, and review of the local plan. The entity shall  review and consider 
 comments from the community advisory committee.
b.                     Recommending annual priorities to be addressed by the plan.
c.                     Assisting in parent education and in recruiting parents and other volunteers who may contribute
 to the implementation of the plan.
d.                     Encouraging community involvement in the development and review of the local plan.
e.                     Supporting activities on behalf of individuals with exceptional needs.
f.                     Assisting in parent awareness of the importance of regular school attendance.
g.                     Supporting community involvement in the parent advisory committee established pursuant to
 Section 52063 to encourage the inclusion of parents of individuals with exceptional needs to the 
 extent these pupils also fall within one or more of the definitions in Section 42238.01”.
 
The Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement and the Division of Special Education are requesting a motion by the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education to appoint members to the CAC, a state-mandated committee established to advise the Board of Education and the Division of Special Education on the SELPA Local Plan.
 
The individuals in Attachment A were elected by their peers at an in-person or virtual election. They are recommended to be the new representatives of the CAC for a two-year term, or as alternates for a one-year term. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval by the Board of Education of those persons whose names have been submitted for CAC membership will enable the CAC to remain compliant within the guidelines established in the California Education Code, Sections 56190-56194.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approving the requested membership will enable the CAC to continue fulfilling the responsibilities as defined in the California Education Code, Section 56194, and in the SELPA Local Plan for service. If not approved, the District will be out of compliance with state requirements, and sanctions may be issued.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action supports the Board’s initiative to enhance parent engagement and is aligned to the Strategic Plan Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration. There are no changes to the existing policies of the District through this action.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” to include the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; Contract Assignments; and Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services: District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed on Attachment “B” ; and Certification of federal micro-purchase threshold for calendar years 2024/2025 as listed on Attachment “C.”
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Good and General Services:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed in Attachment “B”; and Certify federal micro-purchase threshold for calendar years 2024/2025 as listed on Attachment “C.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the project approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; Contract Assignments; Purchase Orders; and
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request approval of Procurement Action not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and
•                     Goods and General Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts.
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See attached for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Castlebay Lane Charter) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Castlebay Lane Charter, located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 701 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Castlebay Lane Charter (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 701 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Castlebay Lane Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 651 students on a District facility at 19010 Castlebay Lane, Porter Ranch, 91326 in Board District 3 and Region North. Castlebay Lane Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 5, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 804 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Castlebay Lane Charter expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Castlebay Lane Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 357, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
As an affiliated charter school, Castlebay Lane Charter is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Dixie Canyon Community Charter (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 646 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Dixie Canyon Community Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 622 students on a District site at 4220 Dixie Canyon Avenue, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91423 in Board District 3 and Region North. Dixie Canyon Community Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 752 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Dixie Canyon Community Charter expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 6, 2025, Dixie Canyon Community Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 4, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 358, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Dixie Canyon Community Charter is part of the District for purposes of special education.
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 360, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies is part of the District for purposes of special education.
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter (“Charter School”), located in Board District 4 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 510 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter is a TK-8 school currently serving 488 students on a District site at 15530 Hesby Street, Encino, CA 91436 in Board District 4 and Region North. Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 5, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 585 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 6, 2025, Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 4, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 361, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.

Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 426 students on a District site at 6170 Lockhurst Drive, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 in Board District 3 and Region North. Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 540 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 363, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies (“Charter School”), with a benchmark in the area of academics (see Attachment A), located in Board District 4 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2030, to serve up to 563 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies is a TK-5 school currently serving 511 students on a District site at 5014 Serrania Avenue, Woodland Hills, CA 91364 in Board District 4 and Region North. Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 715 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupils progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 366-24/25, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Authorization of a Resolution of the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District Approving the Sales of a Previously Authorized Judgment Obligation Bonds, and Related Documents and Actions, including an Official Statement, Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Program) Recommends approval for the issuance of an additional series of Judgment Obligation Bonds to refund all or a portion of significant tort liability obligations from AB 218 and similar claims. The issuance of Additional JOBs is limited to the parameters included in the Board-approved Judgment Refunding Resolution. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the attached resolution (Attachment A) (the “Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution”) relating to the sales of additional series of judgment obligation bonds (the “Additional JOBs”) in accordance with the previously approved program to refund all or a portion of significant involuntary tort liability obligations arising as a result of litigation brought by application of California Assembly Bill Number 218 (“AB 218”) and similar childhood sexual assault, abuse and/or molestation claims for tort liability (the “Judgment Refunding Program”), and authorize the designated officers as described in the attached resolution.  The issuance of Additional JOBs is limited to the parameters included in the Board-approved Judgment Refunding Resolution (defined below).
end
 
Body
Background: 
On June 18, 2024, the Board approved the issuance of Judgment Obligation Notes, Judgment Obligation Bonds and a revolving line of credit as part of the Judgment Refunding Program to refund anticipated significant involuntary tort liability obligations arising as a result of litigation brought by application of AB 218 and similar claims for tort liability, as well as the judicial validation of such obligations (the “Judgment Refunding Resolution”).  Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Resolution, the Board has authorized the issuance of judgment obligation bonds from time to time subject to certain limitations contained therein, including the issuance of the Additional JOBs   
 
Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Resolution, in June 2024, the District filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles seeking judicial confirmation of the validity of the transactions contemplated in the Judgment Refunding Resolution, including, without limitation, judgment obligation bonds and the execution and delivery of an Indenture, Supplemental Indentures, a Revolving Credit Agreement and related Promissory Notes.  The requested judgment in the validation action has been judicially approved and the period for appeals has now run.
 
 
The first issuance of judgment obligation bonds is intended to be completed in July 2025 in order to refund tort claims arising under AB 218, as well as refund certain tax and revenue anticipation notes issued to pay AB 218 tort claims while the validation action was pending. The Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution poises the District to be ready for subsequent sales of judgment obligation bonds as and when necessary, from time to time, under the Judgment Refunding Resolution, in order to refund tort liability obligations arising under AB 218 which continue to arise.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the Judgment Obligation Bond Resolution will authorize the sales of subsequent series of judgment obligation bonds already authorized to be issued under the Judgment Refunding Resolution.
 
Given the potential liability amounts likely to result from the AB 218 tort claims discussed above, payment of such obligations in full upon conclusion of the related litigation would result in significant impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in fiscal year 2025-26 and future fiscal years.  The Additional JOBs would be sold to refund the tort liability obligations and amortize the liability over time, therefore, lessening potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not proceed with additional sales of judgment obligation bonds to pay the tort claims discussed above. In such case, the liability resulting from the tort claims will generally be payable in full as and when the litigation with respect to each claim is concluded from any available moneys of the District. Depending on the timing and size of the liabilities, District budgetary resources may need to be shifted away from programs to pay such liabilities.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article I, Article II Section 2.02, and Article IV Section 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Additional JOBs will be obligations of the District, payable from general fund balances and revenues. However, given the potential liability amounts likely to result from the tort claims discussed above, payment of such obligations in full upon conclusion of the related litigation would result in significant impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in fiscal year 2025-26 and future fiscal years. The Judgment Refunding Program, including sales of Additional JOBs, has been established to mitigate and manage these impacts by refunding the tort liability obligations and amortizing the liability over time, therefore, lessening any potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.
 
Student Impact:
Sales of the Additional JOBs will further the goals of the Judgment Refunding Program of mitigating and managing impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in the current and future fiscal years by refunding expected tort liability obligations and amortizing the liability over time, therefore, lessening any potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.

The Judgment Refunding Program actively recognizes historical inequities by addressing the involuntary tort liability obligations arising from AB 218 and similar claims for tort liability. These obligations result from alleged misconduct by District personnel and have led to significant legal liabilities for the District.



Resource Prioritization

     4

The Judgment Refunding Program effectively prioritizes resources based on need. The program is designed to manage the significant financial impact of tort liability obligations on the District’s budget, thereby ensuring that resources can continue to be allocated effectively to meet the needs of students and the wider school community.  The Notes as a means of temporary finance is designed to manage the potential financial impact of the Involuntary Tort Claims on the District’s budget, thereby ensuring that resources can continue to be allocated effectively to meet the needs of students and the wider school community.



Results

     3

The Judgment Refunding Program is likely to result in closed opportunity gaps. By managing the financial impact of significant tort liability obligations, the program helps ensure that the District can continue to provide essential services and opportunities to students, particularly those from underserved communities.  The Notes, as an interim component to the Judgment Refunding Program, are likely to result in closed opportunity gaps. By managing the financial impact of potential tort liability obligations, application of the Note proceeds will help to ensure that the District can continue to provide essential services and opportunities to students, particularly those from underserved communities.

Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution will enable the District to sell an additional series of judgment obligation bonds under the Judgment Refunding Program, which will help manage the financial impact of the tort liability obligations. Sales of the Additional JOBs will allow the District to spread the liability over time, mitigating the immediate financial impact.

(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

(Approve the Proposed Update of the Debt Management Policy)
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the proposed Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) set forth in Attachment A. Recommends approval of the proposed Debt Management Policy requires the District to review the Policy annually. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer proposes recommended changes for Board approval to provide formal guidance for prudent debt management within the District.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The District currently maintains certain financial policies, as prescribed by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) as “best practices”, including a Debt Management Policy.  These policies are critical to the District’s credit ratings, as they set forth the types of conservative budgeting, debt management, and investment practices that protect the fiscal integrity of the District.  
 
The Debt Management Policy establishes formal guidelines for the issuance of various types of debt instruments and other long-term financial obligations to assure prudent debt management. These guidelines also assist in the strategic planning for the District’s capital improvement projects.  
 
The Policy requires the District to review the Policy annually, with the Chief Financial Officer proposing any recommended changes to the Board.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Shall satisfy the requirement that any material changes to the Debt Management Policy be reviewed and approved by the Board, and shall maintain the District’s “best practices” in the area of debt management.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may approve the proposed Debt Management Policy that will incorporate the following recommended changes:
 
1)                     There were no changes to the District’s credit ratings in FY 2024-25.
 
2)                     Background: 
Original Text: The policies set forth in this Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) have been developed to provide guidelines for the issuance of general obligation bonds (“GO Bonds”), certificates of participation (“COPs”) and other lease-backed financings, tax and revenue anticipation notes (“TRANs”), and other forms of indebtedness by the Los Angeles Unified School District (the “District”). 
While the issuance of debt can be an appropriate method of financing capital projects or annual cash flow management, careful and consistent monitoring of such debt issuance is required to preserve the District’s credit strength and budgetary and financial flexibility.
 
Revised Text: The policies set forth in this Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) have been developed to provide guidelines for the issuance of general obligation bonds (“GO Bonds”), certificates of participation  (“COPs”) and other lease-backed financings, tax and revenue anticipation notes (“TRANs”), and other forms of indebtedness. In 2024, the District approved the issuance of judgment obligation bonds and notes (“JOBs”) and a revolving credit facility (“RCA”) to assist it in prudently amortizing and/or restructuring its tort liabilities over time. While the issuance of debt can be an appropriate method of financing capital projects, extraordinary liabilities, and annual cash flow management, careful and consistent monitoring of such debt issuance is required to preserve the District’s credit strength and budgetary and financial flexibility. 
 
3)                     Article I. Purpose and Goals: Added the following text, “and other forms of indebtedness”
 
4)                     Section 2.02  Types of Debt Authorized to be Issued 
                      A.  Short-Term Debt: Added the following text, “Short-term notes including TRANs or RCAs may also be issued in conjunction with the District’s JOB program as described in Section 2.02 D below.”
 
                     D.  Judgment Obligation Bonds (“JOBs”): Added the following text, “JOBs may be used in conjunction with an RCA.  Prior to the issuance of JOBs, on an interim basis, involuntary tort indebtedness can be repaid through the issuance of notes under an RCA. When sufficient claims are accumulated under the RCA, JOBs would be issued that pay off the notes. In addition, prior to the issuance of JOBs, TRANs may also be issued to pay off involuntary tort liabilities on an interim basis.”
 
5)                     Section 2.04  Annual Review of Debt Policy 
                      Deleted the following sentence, “The Board is the obligated issuer of all District debt and awards all purchase contracts for bonds, COPs/LRBs, TRANs, and any other debt issuances.”
 
6)                     Section 3.01 Structure of Debt Issues: 
                      Maturity of Debt: Added the following text, “for capital projects” 
 
                          Added sub-section 3.01A(iv): “Judgement Obligation Bonds:  The Board has authorized JOBs to be amortized for up to 20 years.   This amortization period will enable the District to mitigate and manage the impact of large tort liabilities on its budgetary resources.”
7)                     Section 3.07 Debt Issued to Finance Operating Costs: Added the following text, “however may be paid from any moneys of the District lawfully available”
 
8)                     Section 3.08  Credit Rating Methodologies and Debt Burden Ratios
i)                     Subsection B (iv) changes:  
(1)                     Variable-Rate COPs Issues was changed to Variable-Rate Debt. “Portfolio of COPs/LRBs was changed to “debt portfolio”.
(2)                     Added the following text, “However, the District may use variable rate interim financing above this limit where the intent is to refund the interim financing with fixed-rate financing within 13 months and the variable rate issuance is necessary to facilitate the refinancing.”
 
ii)                     Subsection D changes: Table 2 (Debt Burden Ratio) was removed. Moody’s no longer provides                      the information.  
 
The Board may prefer not to adopt the revised Policy and have the current Policy remain in effect.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with Section 2.04 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
No budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
The Debt Management Policy ensures that debt issuance is done in a fiscally prudent manner, which in turn minimizes the cost to the General Fund and maximizes the funds available for educating students.
 
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

      2

The Debt Management Policy vaguely recognizes historical inequities.



Resource Prioritization

      4

One of the policy objectives listed in Article I, Purpose and Goals, of the Debt Management Policy, specifies that when projects are selected to be financed by bond proceeds, these projects support the district’s future needs and goals. This objective effectively prioritizes resources based on student needs.



Results

      3

The Debt Management Policy is intended to provide guidelines for the issuance of debt, as a method of financing capital projects. These projects prioritize student needs, especially in communities that have experienced historical inequities, which may result in closing opportunity gaps and/or achievement gaps.

(Approval of the Certification of Signatures for Fiscal Year 2025-26) Recommends approval for the Certification of Signatures for Fiscal Year 2025-26, designating authorized individuals to sign warrants and approve payment vouchers on behalf of the District in compliance with Education Code Sections 42632 and 42633. This action ensures timely processing of payments by maintaining up-to-date signature records with the Los Angeles County Office of Education.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approval of the following for Fiscal Year 2025-26:
1)                     Obtain and submit the Certification of Signatures for each Board Member (including any new member of the Board elected subsequent to this report) to the Los Angeles County of Education (LACOE) as required under section 42633 of the Education Code. (Attachment A).
2)                     Authorize Christopher D. Mount-Benites, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to sign in the name of the Governing Board, all orders (warrants/checks) drawn on the funds of the Los Angeles Unified School District. In addition, authorize Ernie Thomas, Controller, to sign such orders in the event the CFO is unavailable.
3)                     Authorize Christa Crawford, Deputy Controller, Araceli Pineda, Director of Payroll Administration, and Richard Banaag, Interim Head Accountant of the Accounts Payable Branch, to approve payment vouchers (the authority to pay vendor invoices).
If a new individual occupies one of the named positions in #1 - 3 above, staff is authorized to gather new signatures and submit them to LACOE.
end
 
Body
Background: 
This is an annual Board Report to update the District’s Certification of Signatures, which shows all signatures of the members of the Governing Board and employees of the District authorized to sign warrants (checks).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The Certification of Signatures, along with designation of Accounts Payable voucher approvers listed above will be submitted to LACOE in accordance with Education Code Sections 42632 and 42633.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
This action enables the designated offices listed above to sign orders for warrants and payments for Fiscal Year 2025-26. Per Education Code 42633, no order of funds of the District can be approved unless the signatures are on file with LACOE. 
 
Per Education Code 42632, if the Board does not designate an individual to sign orders in the Board’s name, each order drawn on funds of the District must be signed by a majority of the Board members.
 
Policy Implications: 
There is no change to the District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
None
 
Student Impact:
This Board Report facilitates the payment of invoices to purchase a variety of goods and services provided to students.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable

(Submission of 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Categorical Aid Programs) Recommends approval of the FY 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Funding Categorical Aid Programs so that the Superintendent’s FY2025-26 Budget can reflect the estimated total entitlement of $439.2 million across Titles I, II, III, and IV.
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorization to submit the 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Funding Categorical Aid Programs to the California Department of Education (CDE) and that the estimated entitlement amount for programs in the Consolidated Application be included in the Superintendent’s 2025-26 Budget. 
 



   Funding Source

           Amount



  Title I, Part A (Socioeconomically Disadvantaged) 

        $375,256,523



  Title II, Part A (Effective Teachers and Leaders) 

        $  27,283,285



  Title III, Part A (English Learners) 

        $ 10,029,250



  Title IV, Part A (Student Support and Academic Enrichment) 

        $ 26,665,280



                                                                                      TOTAL 

        $439,234,338


 
Body
Background: 
The Consolidated Application has become a multi-part data collection with multiple due dates throughout the year. The Consolidated Application and Reporting System (CARS) Data Collection Schedules are as follows:
 
2025-2026 CARS Spring Data Collection - certification due 08/15/2025.
 
2025-2026 CARS Winter Data Collection - certification due 02/15/2026.
 
The Consolidated Application will continue to collect the following information: applications for federal funding, legal assurances, categorical program budget and expenditure reports, and categorical program activity reports.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of the FY 2025-26 Consolidated Application will allow the district to file multiple Consolidated Application Data Collections with the California Department of Education.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A consequence of not submitting the application is the elimination of supplemental programs that provide direct services. The impact will be an estimated loss of more than $439.2 million dollars for the 25-26 fiscal year. Central offices and school sites that receive funding through the Consolidated Application (across Titles I-IV) will need to look at other sources of funding for budgeted positions and expenditures for the 25-26 fiscal year.
 
Policy Implications: 
No District policy will be changed by approval of this action.
 
Budget Impact: 
The estimated entitlement amount of $439.2 million in federal programs includes the following:

        $439,234,338


 
Student Impact:
The federal formula grant funds have a direct impact on students, their teachers, and their parents. 
•                     Title I, Part A (Socioeconomically Disadvantaged) $375,256,523
funds provide instructional supports and interventions for at-risk, homeless, and neglected students, and pay for supplemental instructional materials, parent engagement activities, curricular trips, and equipment such as computers and projectors for instructional use. Title I, Part A funds also support the funding of supplemental positions such as teachers, counselors, psychologists, teacher assistants, coordinators, instructional coaches, community reps for parent engagement, etc. 
 
•                     Title I, Part A and Title II, Part A (Effective Teachers and Leaders) $27,283,285
funds support professional development for teachers, support staff, and instructional leaders. Title II funds are also used to support induction programs for beginning teachers, teaching and administrative credentials, the professional learning network, and the district’s teacher and administrator evaluation processes.
 
•                     Title III, Part A (English Learners) $10,029,250
funds provide professional development to teachers and school leaders. English Learner Coaches, newcomer programs, and other instructional supports for English Learners and immigrants are provided through these funds.
 
•                     Title IV, Part A (Student Support and Academic Enrichment) $26,665,280
funds provide programs to support a well-rounded education, including but not limited to professional development on STEAM, Secondary Math, Elementary English Language Arts, and college and career readiness. This program also supports safe and healthy schools through professional development, materials, and direct services. Title IV also supports effective integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
 
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Rationale



Recognition

    3

The funds allocated via the Consolidated Application are formula-funded grants that are heavily based upon the number of children in low-income families (Title I, II, and IV) or the number of English Language Learners (Title III).



Resource Prioritization

    3

Resources (i.e., Title I and III) allocated to schools are based upon the needs of students and are described in the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). For all funds received through the Consolidated Application that are centrally administered, schools are prioritized to receive services based on need, e.g., if they are identified by the state’s accountability system, or other data.



Results

    3

Implementation of an evidence-based program is required for Title I funds allocated to schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorization for the following actions:
 
(1)                     Adoption of the Proposed 2025-26 Budget to be filed, as approved, with the County Superintendent of Schools on State Form SACS-2025 in the manner prescribed by law.
 
(2)                     Delegation of authority to the Budget Services and Financial Planning Division and the Accounting and Disbursements Division to take all actions necessary to implement the Budget Assumptions and Policies set forth in this Board Report (Attachment B).
 
(3)                     Approval of the enclosed Resolution Regarding Expenditures from the Educational Protection Account (“EPA”) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025-26 in accordance with the provision of Proposition 30 (Attachment C).
 
(4)                     Delegation of authority to the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Controller, or their designee to make interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings in accordance with the 2025-26 adopted LA Unified budget and Education Code section 42603. For reference, see Attachment E for a history of interfund transfers.
 
(5)                     Approval of the enclosed Resolution to Commit Funding to Protect Against Federal Uncertainties (Attachment F).
end
 
Body
Background: 
Annually, the Board of Education (Board) must hold a public hearing and adopt a budget consistent with the provisions of Education Code Section 42127.  Upon adoption, the budget is to be submitted to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) on or before July 1.
 
With the passage of Proposition 30, LA Unified shall receive part of its State entitlement through revenues from the Education Protection Account (EPA).  In order to receive these entitlements, the Board must, at an open meeting, make spending determinations regarding EPA funds.  
Proposition 30 revenues, extended by Proposition 55 through 2030, are allocated to school districts through the EPA.  These are not additional funds outside of the Local Control Funding Formula, but rather another source of the general purpose funds (similar to local property taxes) that offsets what would otherwise be state funding.
 
EPA funds may not be used for any salaries or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs. LA Unified is also required to annually publish on its website an accounting of how much EPA funds were received and how the funds were spent.
 
Sections 42127 and 52062 of the Education Code require two separate Governing Board public meetings for the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and the Budget, one for the public hearing of the LCAP and Budget and a subsequent meeting for the adoption. The LCAP public hearing and adoption must occur at the same meetings as the budget public hearing and adoption. 
 
As required by Senate Bill (SB) 858/751, Attachment D sets forth the minimum reserve level required in each year, amounts of assigned and unassigned ending balance that exceed the minimum, and reasons for the reserve being greater than the minimum. 
 
The interfund transfer and temporary borrowing authorization is an annual request to allow staff to process accounting transactions related to interfund transfers and temporary borrowings. Interfund transfers are made between funds for various purposes, including transfers for debt service requirements. Temporary borrowings are made in situations where LA Unified advances cash from a fund with sufficient cash balance to pay obligations of a fund with insufficient cash balance. Repayments of the cash advances are made within statutory timelines.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The expected outcome is an adopted budget for FY 2025-26 that shall enable LA Unified to comply with Education Code Section 42127. A further expected outcome is adoption of Resolution Regarding EPA expenditures for 2025-26.  Additionally, approval of the Resolution to Commit Funding to Protect Against Federal Uncertainties shall ensure funds are used for a specific purpose(s) unless the Board takes subsequent formal action to uncommit the originally imposed constraint. Furthermore, approval of interfund transfers and temporary borrowings authorization shall ensure that interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings are authorized beginning in July 2025.  This will enable LA Unified staff to make required and timely interfund transfers or temporary borrowings in the 2025-26 fiscal year.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board adopt the item, approve authorizing the proposed actions, LA Unified will meet the annual budget adoption requirements of Education Code Section 42127. 
 
If the Board does not authorize the proposed actions, LA Unified will not meet the requirements of Education Code Section 42127.  Non-approval of the EPA resolution as set forth in Proposition 30, extended by Proposition 55, may place the EPA entitlement at risk.  Without approval to commit funding to protect against federal uncertainties, LA Unified will not be able to implement any proposed changes to commitments. Without prior approval to process interfund transfers and temporary borrowings, LA Unified staff will not have the authority to make required and timely interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings in Fiscal Year 2025-26.
 
Policy Implications: 
Adoption of the Proposed 2025-26 Budget, approval of the Resolution Regarding Expenditures from the EPA, approval of the Resolution to Commit Funding to Protect Against Federal Uncertainties, and delegation of authority to make interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings shall comply with the Education Code and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requirements. 
 
Budget Impact: 
Adoption of the Proposed 2025-26 Budget.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code and GASB requirements ensures that LA Unified shall continue to operate and serve its student population responsibly.

The proposed budget is LA Unified’s plan for the upcoming school year 2025-26 related to anticipated revenues and expenditures for all LA Unified funds with the General Fund being the largest fund. This budget includes Federal, State, and Local resources that are allocated directly to schools based on student needs that are measured by various indicators.  Resources are allocated to address student needs. Programs allocated using various needs indicators include, but are not limited to, the Student Equity Needs Index (SENI), Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP), Arts Program, and Title I.



Resource Prioritization

    4

 Within the General Fund is the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) which is the largest unrestricted source of funding for schools. LCFF provides baseline funding for all students and additional resources to schools with high concentrations of low-income students, English Learners, and students in foster care.  



Results

    4

The budget includes investments in schools to improve student achievement and equity across all student groups. The goal is to build fairness and inclusion and ensure every student has the opportunity to achieve their academic goals.

end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)’s 2025 Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a state mandated three-year plan that is updated each year and describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures of Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. Every year, the District partners with our communities to develop and update the LCAP.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The District LCAP must be adopted at the same meeting at which the Board of Education adopts the budget for 2025-2026. The 2025-26 LCAP is the second year of the three year cycle for 2024-27, and provides available baseline and Year 1 outcomes for LCAP metrics and includes annual updates on the implementation of LCAP actions in 2024-25. The LCAP also includes separate Action Tables in addition to the Budget Overview for Parents. These materials must all be combined and posted on the District’s website.
 
Through the LCAP engagement cycle, the LCAP team has had robust engagement with educational partners across the District through student focus groups, parent committee meetings, community partner meetings, District team meetings, labor partner meetings, and Region engagement meetings. Furthermore, the LCAP team supported school principals with an LCAP Coffee with the Principal presentation to assist schools with sharing information about the District LCAP and their school’s progress towards goals in the LCAP, which are aligned with the District's Strategic Plan. The ThoughtExchanges for the LCAP has over 17,000 participants. We are appreciative of the feedback and comments provided by the Parent Advisory Committee, District English Learner Advisory Committee, Superintendent’s Student Advisory Council, and a large number of our educational partners. All voices are important and provide direction to the development of the LCAP. As always, we will continue to work to gather input and feedback from our Los Angeles Unified communities about our programs and services to support students.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this LCAP will allow the District to meet state-mandated requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote, will result in the District meeting the state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
A “No” vote, will result in the District not meeting the state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
Policy Implications: 
The District LCAP is aligned with the District Strategic Plan and reflects annual updates from the 2024-25 school year, and includes planned goals, actions, and expenditures for 2025-26. The 2025-26 LCAP is the second year of the three year cycle for 2024-27. The District may make changes to the LCAP each year to reflect community feedback as well as changes in District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
Approval of the District’s LCAP is necessary to approve the budget. Existing staff and resources will support posting the LCAP to the District website.
 
Student Impact:
This proposed action shares the District’s engagement, planning and budgeting to meet student needs in 2025-26. Through engagement, meetings were held to receive input on the Plan as part of this engagement, and the LCAP ThoughtExchanges collected 161,191 ratings on 10,335 comments from 17,833 participants. In the LCAP ThoughtExchanges, 3,450 participants identified as students.

The LCAP describes how the District will implement programs and policies to support all students in the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) state priority areas, as well as how the District will leverage supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low-income students. Additionally, our communities have advocated for additional transparency and visibility into English Learner Supports and the Black Student Achievement Plan, and the LCAP continues to report on the progress of these programs, analysis, and funding information as official Goals in the document.



Resource Prioritization

       4

As stated above, the LCAP describes how the District will allocate resources in 2025-26 to support the LCFF target student populations (84% of LAUSDs enrollment), as well as additional investments for non- LCFF target student populations (including Black students and Special Education students).



Results

       4

The LCAP allocates and annually monitors the use of LCFF dollars to improve student equity across all student groups by eliminating opportunity gaps and preparing students to be ready for the world as evidenced in District goals and actions.

The LCAP describes how the District will implement programs and policies to support all students in the LCFF state priority areas, as well as how the District will leverage supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low-income students. The LCAP is aligned to reflect 2022-26 Strategic Plan Pillars, strategies, and priorities.
 
The LCAP includes all state LCFF funds and Equity Multiplier Funds for Equity Multiplier eligible schools, but does not reflect any other local, state, and federal sources of funding.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the Affiliated Charter Schools’ 2025 Local Control and Accountability Plans. The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a state mandated three-year plan that is updated each year and describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures of Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. Every year, the 51 Affiliated Charter Schools develop and update their LCAPs.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Based on the state Education Code, each Affiliated Charter School is its own local education agency, so each must complete a separate written LCAP. These LCAPS must be adopted at the same meeting at which the Board of Education adopts the budget for 2025-2026. The 2025-26 LCAP is the first year of the three year cycle for 2024-27 and provides available Baseline and Year 1 Outcomes for LCAP metrics and includes annual updates on the implementation of LCAP actions in 2024-25. The LCAPs also include separate Action Tables in addition to the Budget Overviews for Parents. These materials must all be combined and posted on each Affiliated Charter School's website.
 
As part of the District’s support for our 51 Affiliated Charter Schools, the District LCAP team supports the development of these LCAPs by providing budgetary and metric data along with working with Affiliated Charter Schools to share specific school LCAP information to communicate the progress at their school sites. Affiliated Charter Schools are supported by the LCAP team through ongoing training, guidance and direct support that spans year-round, which includes hybrid office hours, work group sessions and one-on-one consultations to ensure compliance and alignment to the District LCAP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these LCAPs will allow District Affiliated Charter Schools to meet the state-mandated requirement.
 
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
A “No” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools not meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
Approval of these Affiliated Charter Schools’ LCAPs is necessary to approve their budgets. Existing staff and resources will support posting the LCAP to the District and Affiliated Charter Schools’ websites.

The Affiliated Charter Schools LCAPs include all state LCFF funds and Equity Multiplier Funds for Equity Multiplier eligible schools, but does not reflect any other local, state, and federal sources of funding. The 2025 Affiliated Charter Schools LCAPs also address a requirement first implemented through state mandate in 2023 to calculate and report carryover of unspent supplemental and concentration funds to support future increased or improved services. This carryover calculation only reflects funds that are under school discretion and which carry over within these schools’ budgets.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote would effectuate the processing of personnel actions for classified, certificated and senior management employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer and new appointments.
 
A “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints, impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.

RecommendationAction Proposed: Ratification for the 2024-25 Career Technical Education Incentive Grant (CTEIG) total award of $13,269,537 (July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2026). BodyBackground: This annual California Department of Education (CDE) formula-based grant provides LAUSD with funding to strengthen and enhance the District's Career Technical Education (CTE) program. Per CDE, students in CTE pathways have higher attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and increased post-secondary enrollment rates. Our grant award supports students in over 450 career pathways at 167 schools, while preparing them for post-secondary and career opportunities, with special emphasis on careers (Pillar 1: Academic Excellence, Priority D: College and Career Readiness). All schools with a CTE pathway are included in the grant, as outlined in Attachment A. The grant funds are expected to support:* CTE staff salaries* Supplementary salaries for professional development/special CTE projects* Instructional material/consumables/non-capital equipment and software* Professional services (e.g., curriculum development, certification services, annual CTE career guide)* Capital equipment* Indirect costs related to the administration of the grant fundsExpected Outcomes:The Board ratifies the grant award. The funding is expected to help:* Increase the number of students who will:(a) Acquire technical and career-ready skills through growing CTE pathways(b) Earn industry-recognized certifications to gain employable skills(c) Complete CTE pathways and transition to post-secondary institutions to advance their skills for careers of their choice* Create an experience of a continuum of work-based learning opportunities for participating students* Increase the number of career pathways with industry-standard equipment, materials, and work-based learning integrated into the curriculum* Increase industry sector pathways with high-wage and high-demand occupations as identified by current local labor market research* Develop a deeper understanding of the purpose and benefits of CTE programs among all students and stakeholders* Increase the number of dual enrollment and articulation agreements through partnerships with the Los Angeles Community College District postsecondary schools* Increase the number of District teachers with industry-relevant training and externships* Increase recruitment and retention of CTE teachersBoard Options and Consequences: The Board has the option of voting ""Yes"" to ratify the award of these grant funds or voting ""No"" to decline these funds.A ""No"" vote would decrease students' access to funds for industry-specific, professional-grade materials, equipment, work-based learning, and certifications.A ""Yes"" vote would provide students with access to additional CTEIG-funded materials, equipment, work-based learning, and certifications within their CTE pathways, beginning in the 2025-26 school year.Policy Implications: None.Budget Impact: The CTEIG grant will have no additional budget impact on LAUSD. It operates on a 2:1 matching basis, meaning for every $1 of grant funding received, LAUSD has already incurred $2 in qualifying CTE-related expenditures. Match expenditures (2 to 1) have already been incurred in fiscal year 2025, and the amount was verified before the grant was awarded.Student Impact:* Career exploration and guidance opportunities for students* Pathway alignment with community colleges* Better instruction via elevated teaching through CTEIG-funded training, externships, and professional development* Increased attainment of industry-specific certifications and trainingEquity Impact:Component  ScoreScore RationalRecognition       3This CTEIG grant recognizes historical inequities as the California Department of Education (CDE) deliberates in promoting equity and access to Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. CTE programs are evaluated based, in part, on the measurement of how an applicant provides opportunities for the participation of ""pupils who are individuals with exceptional needs."" ComponentScoreScore Rational Resource Prioritization       3Resource prioritization of this grant is based on student need, as LAUSD prioritizes schools and pathways that have received less funding from other grant sources (e.g., Perkins, Strong Workforce Program, previous CTEIG grants). Grant funds also aid in supporting teacher professional development and conferences aimed at building educator capacity to address achievement gaps among special populations. The grant funds are also utilized to purchase industry-standard equipment and integrate work-based learning curriculum for CTE pathways to ensure all students are prepared for college and careers. Results       3CTE classes and pathways provide opportunities for students to explore careers and develop career-ready skills that lead to living wage employment, which is needed in areas with opportunity and achievement gaps. Total       9Issues and Analysis: To be eligible for funding, LAUSD's high schools with CTE programs must meet a number of requirements as outlined in the CTEIG Request for Applications. These include a $2 for every $1 match requirement and a commitment to provide high-quality CTE programs with a focus on preparing students for college and careers. The application process requires schools to describe how they will improve their CTE programs and demonstrate how their budget aligns with those plans.The grant funding is subject to several limitations and non-allowable expenditures. The funds must be fully expended by December 31, 2026. Non-allowable costs include, but are not limited to:* Supplanting: Using grant funds for existing services that would be paid for by other sources.* General Purpose Costs: Expenditures for items that are not directly and exclusively for the CTE program, such as general classroom furniture (desks, chairs), general-purpose data systems, and routine school utilities or facility repair.* Personnel & Fees: Certain personnel costs, such as bonuses, and fees for teacher credentialing or fingerprinting, are not allowable.* Personal Use: Grant funds cannot be used to acquire or use CTE equipment for personal or administrative purposes.* Matching Funds Pressure: LAUSD must identify and sustain matching funds for each grant dollar. Given the District's CTE footprint, this may create fiscal pressure, particularly as CTEIG requires a 2:1 match ratio. Matching may come from general fund or Perkins but this reduces flexibility in other programmatic areas.Grant recipients must also submit annual expenditure reports and CTE completer data, and any capital outlay requests for single items over $5,000 require pre-approval from the California Department of Education. To ensure the sustainability of the programs, the schools must maintain the CTEIG pathway investments made at their campus for the duration of the grant allocation received.

(Textbooks and Instructional Materials Certification Resolution) Recommends Adoption of the attached resolution (Attachment A) certifying the sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached resolution certifying the sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials in the core and required subject areas.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Pursuant to Education Code Section 60119, the Board of Education is required to annually make a determination, through a resolution after a public hearing, whether all students in District schools have sufficient textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in the core and required subject areas. These areas include mathematics, science, history/social science, reading/language arts, including the English Language Development (ELD) component, health, and world language (6-12).  Moreover, the public hearing must be scheduled at a time that will encourage the attendance of teachers and parents and guardians of pupils who attend District schools, and it shall not take place during or immediately following school hours.
 
The District has taken the following significant actions to ensure sufficient textbooks in the targeted core and required subjects:
 
•                     Allocated $87 million in FY 2025-26 for Core and Required textbooks.
•                     Required all teachers to certify textbook sufficiency in their classrooms.
•                     Required all principals to certify textbook sufficiency in their schools.
•                     Required Region Superintendents to resolve identified insufficiencies in a timely manner.
•                     Required Region Superintendents to certify sufficiency in their respective regions.
•                     Provided Region personnel with clear policies and procedures.
•                     Development of a centralized database to track all appropriate textbook requests, certifications, and Los Angeles County of Education (LACOE) audit results.
•                     Conducted follow-up on all insufficiencies identified as a result of norm day enrollment projections.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The Board will adopt the attached resolution declaring the District has sufficient textbooks, thus meeting compliance with Education Code Section 60119.
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles is required to conduct a public hearing to certify compliance with Education Code Section 60119. If the District is found to have insufficient textbooks in the core and required subject areas and cannot remedy the insufficiency within three days of the Board of Education’s meeting, the county superintendent would request the California Department of Education (CDE) purchase the textbooks or instructional materials necessary to comply with the sufficiency requirement. The funds used to make this purchase of instructional materials would be considered a loan that LAUSD would need to repay to the CDE. The CDE would also issue a public statement at the next State Board of Education meeting indicating that the LAUSD Superintendent and Board of Education failed to provide students with sufficient instructional materials.
 
Policy Implications: 
There is no change in District policy of targeting funding to purchase textbooks to ensure full compliance with Education Code Section 60119.
 
Budget Impact: 
General Fund and Lottery apportionment from the State are the budgeting expenditures for textbooks, 4000 - object code. Of the $87 million allocated in FY 2025-26 for Core and Required textbooks, as of September 2, 2025, approximately $17.4 million has been expended.

Main Street, Los Angeles (Gompers), 911 S. Hoover Street, Los Angeles (Hoover), 1049 N. Fairfax Avenue, West Hollywood (Fairfax COS), and 5717 Rudnick Avenue, Woodland Hills (Collins), (collectively, the Sites), maximizing affordable housing units for Los Angeles Unified employees (Employees).endBodyBackground: On June 8, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) authorized the Facilities Services Division to conduct the due diligence activities necessary to identify options for providing affordable employee and family housing (referred to as the Housing Initiative). From November 2023 and January 2024, Los Angeles Unified issued a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) to gauge development sector interest in redeveloping nine District-owned sites. Responses demonstrated strong interest from experienced developers along with potential financing strategies.Between May to September 2024, the District conducted comprehensive surveys and focus groups to assess employee and family housing needs (Survey).  Results showed significant demand and ongoing housing insecurity. In April 2025, Los Angeles Unified retained the Volz Company, LLC, in association with Gensler, (Volz) to complete a feasibility study including site and financial analyses of the nine original sites, four of which were identified as viable for development.  Further analysis found that affordable housing projects prioritized for employees are both feasible and timely.  These four sites are recommended to proceed into an RFQP that aligns with the District's Housing Initiative goals (Goals):1. Attract and retain qualified teachers and staff2. Enhance Los Angeles Unified competitiveness as an employer3. Support work-life balance and employee wellness4. Reduce commute times and environmental impact5. Foster community ties between employees and neighborhoods6. Maximize use of District resources to support students and staff The RFQP will invite proposals to design, construct, finance, and manage housing developments on one or more sites, prioritizing Employee occupancy. Proposers may recommend development and financing models that best support the District's goals.Upon selection of a successful Proposer, staff will request authorization from the Board to enter into development agreements.Gompers is located in Region South, Board District 7 (Tanya Ortiz Franklin), Hoover is located in Region West, Board District 5 (Karla Griego), Fairfax COS is located in Region West, Board District 4 (Nick Melvoin), and Collins is located in Region North, Board District 4 (Nick Melvoin). Expected Outcomes:Approval of the action will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP for the development of the Sites. Selection of a development partner through the RFQP process will advance the Los Angeles Unified's efforts to address the housing affordability challenges faced by many employees, strengthen workforce recruitment and retention, and reinforce Los Angeles Unified's commitment to its Housing Initiative goals.Board Options and Consequences: A ""yes"" vote will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP for the development of the Sites and continue advancing Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative.A ""no"" vote will not authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP.  As a result, Los Angeles Unified will not continue seeking opportunities that provide affordable Employee housing.Policy Implications: Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative has identified a growing need to provide affordable Employee housing. The proposed action advances the Housing Initiative and opportunities for achieving its Goals. Budget Impact: The activities associated with preparing the RFQP and negotiating agreements with the Project Proposers require staff time from the Facilities Services Division and the Office of the General Counsel which are General Fund overhead expenses. Student Impact: Providing stable and affordable Employee housing helps mitigate negative externalities on students that arise from Employee housing insecurity and creates the opportunity for Employees to instead focus on student success. Furthermore, increasing workforce housing security will correspondingly decrease Employee turnover, creating significant efficiencies that can be directed to support student wellness and academic achievement by fostering a more stable, engaged, and connected school community.Equity Impact:By creating equitable access to affordable, stable, and nearby housing, the initiative supports a more diverse and inclusive workforce, strengthens employee retention, and fosters greater continuity and connection within school communities, ultimately contributing to improved outcomes for all students.Issues and Analysis:The 2024 Survey results indicated that almost half (46%) of employee respondents have considered leaving their job due to high housing costs and over 6,000 employees (52%) expressed interest in Los Angeles Unified affordable housing.  The development of workforce housing may allow Employees to live in affordable, safe, and stable housing within the communities they work in. Los Angeles Unified invests millions of dollars annually in general and grant funds to recruit, hire, train and develop teachers and staff. These investments are diminished when Employees leave Los Angeles Unified employment.  Research from the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley has shown that access to housing affordability is a key factor in improving employee retention, particularly among early-career educators and classified staff. Workforce housing represents a strategic investment in sustaining a strong, consistent, and effective workforce to support student success.To help address the issues above, and to achieve Los Angeles Unified's Goals, the RFQP will include key evaluation criteria such as:1. Alignment with Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative Goals.2. Optimization of sites to provide affordable Employee housing.3. Prioritization of tenancy by Employees earning between the 30-120% Area Median Income brackets.4. Prioritization of tenancy and rent-setting control for Los Angeles Unified Employees.5. Assurance that no out-of-pocket financial contribution will be required by Los Angeles Unified.6. Preservation of the long-term value of the property and ownership for Los Angeles Unified.7. Experience with and commitment to full and sole responsibility for ongoing operations, management, and maintenance of the development(s).8. Plans for robust community engagement.Staff will continue to work with Volz to issue the RFQP and evaluate the proposals.  If financial viability cannot be achieved while providing 100% affordable Employee units on any of the Sites, special considerations will be given to allow for the following:1. Inclusion of Market-rate units, and2. Land exchanges.Upon selection of the successful Proposer, staff will return to the Board for authorization to enter into applicable agreements to develop the Projects.Although staff expects that there may be interest in developing affordable housing on each of the Sites, there is also a possibility that there are no proposals received and/or there is no Proposer selected for one or more (or all) of the Sites.  If that should happen, staff will provide the Board with an Informative related to the responses, if any, the results, and potential future steps which may include issuing additional RFQP's.

description
(Authorization to Enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Approve $20 Million for an Energy Efficient Lighting Upgrade Program) Recommends authorization to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to allocate $20 million in bond program funds to support LADWPs direct installation of energy-efficient lighting upgrades at up to 150 school sites, and execution authority for implementing the MOU.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the following:
1.                     Approve a new MOU between the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or the District) and the LADWP for a term of 4.5 years, beginning October 27, 2025 to April 26, 2030.
 
2.                     Amend the Facilities SEP to allocate $20 million in bond program funds to support LADWPs direct installation of energy-efficient lighting upgrades at up to 150 school sites that will be executed over the term of the proposed new MOU. 
 
3.                     Authorize the Senior Advisor to the Superintendent and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement this MOU.   
end
 
Body
Background: 
 In 2012, the District entered into an MOU with the LADWP under which the LADWP reimbursed the District for up to $8 million in energy efficiency projects over a two-year term and six-month extension. On February 10, 2015, the Board ratified the MOU with LADWP valued at $45.3 million to effectuate the “Conserving for Our Kids Program,” a multi-pronged strategy to raise energy and water efficiency at District facilities (Board Report No. 321-14/15). An MOU was subsequently executed between the LADWP and the District with a three-year term, and Amendment No. 1 extended the term by two years, for a total term of five years from October 2015 through October 2020 (Board Report No. 290-18/19, April 23, 2019); the activities associated with administering the MOU were funded by M&O Routine Repair and General Maintenance funds. Another MOU valued at $87.5 million, where LADWP contributed up to $72.5 million and the District contributed up to $15 million for energy efficient lighting upgrades, was executed between the LADWP and the District (Board Report No. 108-20/21) to continue the successes of this program for a five-year term from October 2020 through October 2025. A new MOU is now needed to continue these energy and water efficiency efforts, specifically the Direct Install Lighting projects which have been implemented at 157 school sites dating back to 2012. Under the terms of the new MOU, LADWP will invest more funding in energy and water efficiency projects as well as new greening and climate resiliency projects that will help reduce rising utility costs and improve Green House Gas reductions.
 
The new MOU will continue the installation of energy and water efficiency measures at eligible District sites in the LADWP service area. LADWP and its qualified contractors and/or subcontractors will perform the work, and LADWP will reimburse a portion of the District’s administrative and labor costs associated with supporting the projects. The MOU was presented to and approved by the LADWP Board of Supervisors on July 8, 2025.
 
The term of the proposed new MOU is 4.5 years; each calendar year within the term is a “term year.” The total value of this MOU is $120 million between both agencies of which LADWP will invest approximately $100 million towards District upgrades and programs (up to $22.5 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $10 million in term year 5) and Los Angeles Unified will contribute approximately $20 million (up to $4.5 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $2 million in term year 5) in in-kind services and matching funds.
 
The MOU consists of four primary programmatic strategies and maximum funding amounts per year as follows:
 
•                     Direct install energy-efficient lighting upgrade projects: LADWP will contribute up to $18 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $8 million for term year 5 for upgrades at up to 150 school sites. The District shall support the extension of this program with matching funds or in-kind services that shall not exceed a total of 25% of the program’s costs or $4.5 million, whichever is less, per term year (term years 1-4), and up to $2 million or 25% of program costs for term year 5.  
 
Energy efficient lighting upgrade projects will be selected within LADWP service areas with a focus on school sites with high energy use and/or those with high priority that are located within disadvantaged areas and in alignment to help meet the District’s renewable and greening goals. The proposed energy efficiency upgrades will improve the instructional environment at up to 150 schools, lower the District’s carbon footprint, and reduce recurring expenditures for electricity by an estimated $5.5 million annually. 
 
•                     Education and awareness of energy efficiencies: LADWP will contribute up to $1.125 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $500,000 in term year 5. The cost of these efforts will be borne entirely by LADWP. However, front funding by LAUSD may be necessary, and would likely be funded by energy rebates associated with the Eco-Sustainability Office.
•                     Greening/climate resiliency activities: LADWP will contribute up to $2.25 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $1 million for term year 5. The cost of these activities will be borne entirely by LADWP.  These activities may include, but are not limited to: 
o                     Tree opportunities assessments on campuses.
o                     Empty tree well planting.
o                     Turf or pavement removal for new tree wells & trees.
o                     Installation of micro forests.
o                     Educational projects about trees and participating in City Plants.
o                     Educational native and climate-ready gardens/landscapes.
o                     National Wildlife Federation (NWF) Certified landscapes.
o                     On-site stormwater capture and recharge.
o                     Best management practices.
o                     Low impact development infrastructure.
o                     Urban heat island mitigation measures.
o                     Piloting technologies supporting resilience.
o                     Related training for LAUSD maintenance and operations staff.
 
•                     LADWP water conservation incentives: LADWP will contribute up to $1.125 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $500,000 for term year 5 for the installation of high-efficiency fixtures and devices. The cost of these efforts will be borne entirely by LADWP.  However, front funding by LAUSD may be necessary, and would likely be funded by energy rebates associated with the Eco-Sustainability Office.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 4, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these proposed actions will enable the LADWP to continue to support existing and proposed energy efficiency upgrades, new greening and climate resiliency projects, and conservation awareness initiatives through April 2030. On an annual basis, the Eco-Sustainability Office and Facilities will report on the progress of the energy efficient lighting upgrade program related to this MOU.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of these proposed actions will improve processes delineated by the MOU and enable the LADWP to provide proposed energy and water efficiency upgrades, greening and climate resiliency projects, and conservation awareness initiatives through the term of the MOU.
 
If the recommended actions are not approved, replacement of lighting and plumbing fixtures will not be provided at schools with the identified need beyond the current LADWP/LAUSD MOU expiration date of October 26, 2025 and thus the District will not benefit from the cost avoidance that results from such upgrades in fixtures, technologies, and end-user behavior. In addition, students will no longer receive the benefit of education and awareness programs and initiatives supported by the current MOU.
 
Policy Implications: 
These proposed actions are consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The proposal also aligns with the Board Resolution adopted on December 3, 2019, that commits to the goals of “achieving 100 percent clean, renewable energy in its electricity sector by 2030 and in all energy sectors by 2040 working in collaboration with the LADWP’s Sustainable City Plan” (1st Recital to Resolution 018-19/20). 
 
These proposed actions further align with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses).
 
The proposal also advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 1: Academic Excellence by developing educational programs around climate literacy; Strategic Plan Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, indoor and outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools; Strategic Plan Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration by empowering students to take leadership roles as climate champions and environmental stewards; Strategic Plan Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness by implementing energy efficiency and water conservation projects to reduce utility costs to the General Fund; and Strategic Plan Pillar 5: Investing in Staff by creating a sustainability program for professionals that will target the development of climate literacy throughout the schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
Per the MOU, LADWP agrees to fund a maximum of $100 million which includes the work to be executed as well as reimbursing the District for project administrative costs. The District agrees to provide up to $20 million to support energy efficient lighting upgrades at up to 150 school sites. The District’s contribution will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.  While the District’s contribution to this MOU is only for the energy efficient lighting system upgrade projects, some front funding may be required to support implementation of the other three programmatic strategies under the MOU.  
 
Student Impact:
Cost savings from the efficiency programs implemented by the MOU will reduce recurring expenditures for electricity by an estimated $5.5 million annually, thus allow for more financial resources to be allocated to support educational programs. Moreover, students may acquire knowledge through the sustainability and conservation awareness initiatives made possible by the MOU. Active involvement in addressing environmental issues encourages students to become environmental stewards, and such experience can assist in career development preparation for green jobs and sustainability.
 
Equity Impact:
The new MOU will continue the installation of energy and water efficiency measures as well as greening and climate resiliency projects at eligible District sites in the LADWP service area with a focus on school sites with high energy use and/or those with high priority on the District’s Green School Yards Index. A portion of the selected schools shall be located in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the LADWP. Educational and awareness programs will be available to all eligible schools interested in participating.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The MOU would improve processes and extend LADWP’s implementation and funding of energy and water conservation projects, greening and climate resiliency projects, and awareness initiatives, as follows:
•                     In addition to its own qualified employees, LADWP will provide qualified contractors and/or subcontractors who will provide workers that are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) to install agreed upon energy efficiency measures at District school sites. LADWP will bear sole responsibility for its contractors and subcontractors;
•                     The District’s Labor Compliance Department will enforce the payment of prevailing wages to all LADWP contractors and subcontractors, and LADWP, as the awarding body, will cooperate with the Labor Compliance Department pursuant to the terms and requirements outlined in the MOU;
•                     LADWP and/or its contractors and subcontractors will procure mutually agreed upon materials per approved scopes of work to perform the direct installation work;
•                     The District may perform the direct installation work if LADWP does not meet agreed-upon milestones. If the District performs the direct installation work, it will purchase materials and all District materials and labor costs will be reimbursed by LADWP;
•                     The District’s invoicing for reimbursement by LADWP will be bi-monthly (i.e., every other month); and
•                     The District’s labor costs related to the direct installation work will be reimbursed according to the most current District negotiated unburdened hourly rates for identified positions at the time the work is being performed.

Brief Description:
description
(Adoption of the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan) Recommends adoption of the 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP). This plan supports the District with the eligibility for certain federal disaster assistance. The District received conditional approval of the LHMP update from the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) pending formal adoption by the Board of Education (Board). 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve and adopt the Resolution of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education (Attachment A) adopting the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (Attachment B) prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390), the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007, and the latest FEMA guidance effective April 2025. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2004, the District developed a LHMP, which received FEMA approval in 2005. Subsequent LHMPs were prepared and received FEMA approval, and the latest version was adopted and approved in November 2018. The LHMP is typically valid for a period of five years and in order to keep it current, an update is required to reflect the current responsibilities of the District’s divisions, departments and offices and address major natural and human-caused disasters that have the potential to impact District facilities and operations. The updated plan was prepared to ensure the District would be eligible for FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation and Hazard Mitigation Grant programs, explicitly, FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP); Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program; Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program; as well as the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The LHMP also provides the foundation for the District’s long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses. 
Hazard mitigation planning is the process through which hazards that threaten communities are identified, likely impacts determined, mitigation goals set, and appropriate mitigation strategies determined, prioritized, and implemented. This LHMP documents the hazard mitigation planning process and identifies relevant hazards, risks and vulnerabilities, and strategies LA Unified will use to decrease vulnerability and increase resiliency and sustainability in the District and the communities it serves. The planning process began with the organizational phase to establish the Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee. Members were selected following FEMA's guidance which specifies the type of participants needed. Key District and agency stakeholders were invited to LHMP planning meetings and those that chose to participate became committee members. The entire process involved seven meetings. A detailed risk assessment was then conducted followed by the development of a focused mitigation strategy for the District’s Planning Area. 
The District submitted the updated LHMP to CalOES and FEMA for their review and approval. The LHMP was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390), the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007, and the latest FEMA LHMP guidance effective April 2025.On July 18, 2025, the LHMP received conditional approval from FEMA subject to Board adoption.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will approve and adopt the attached Resolution to adopt the LHMP pursuant to requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This action is required for the LHMP to receive formal FEMA approval.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote to adopt the Resolution will enable the District to receive final approval from FEMA for the LHMP and allow the District to apply for funding for pre-disaster mitigation for projects identified in the LHMP as well as grant requests associated with post-disaster funding should a major natural or human-made disaster occur. Moreover, the adopted 2025 LHMP will provide the District with the planning framework for addressing and/or responding to natural disasters. 
 
A “No” vote would not allow the District to receive final approval from FEMA and apply for federal disaster assistance, specifically, the FEMA HMGP, PDM, BRIC, and FMA programs. Additionally, if the Board does not approve and adopt the Resolution adopting the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, the District will need to rely on the outdated 2018 plan, which does not consider new and changing natural hazards. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy. This action helps document the hazard mitigation planning process and identifies relevant hazards, risks and vulnerabilities as well as strategies LA Unified will use to decrease vulnerability and increase resiliency and sustainability in the District and the communities it serves.
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 will serve to augment the District’s emergency planning efforts by formally adopting the LHMP. Continued and enhanced hazard mitigation actions will help ensure that students are provided with a safe and healthy school environment and safe facilities that promote effective learning.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Each year in the United States, natural disasters take the lives of hundreds of people and injure thousands more. Nationwide, taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to help communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals recover from disasters. These monies only partially reflect the true cost of disasters because additional expenses to insurance companies and non-governmental organizations are not reimbursed by tax dollars. Many natural disasters are predictable, and much of the damage caused by these events can be alleviated or even eliminated. The purpose of hazard mitigation is to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards. Adoption and implementation of the District’s 2025 LHMP will demonstrate the District’s commitment to fulfilling its mitigation goals and objectives to meet that end.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions) Recommends the ratification of Procurement Services Division contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including fire life safety training and video creation services and materials testing and special inspection services contracts.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including fire life safety training and video creation services and materials testing and special inspection services contracts.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013 Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 08, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact:
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

(Adoption of the Negative Declaration for the Fairfax High School Major Modernization Project) Recommends adoption of the Negative Declaration for the Fairfax High School (Board District 4, Region West) Major Modernization Project. prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) and State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 §15000 et seq.).

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Review and adopt the Negative Declaration (ND) for the proposed Fairfax High School Major Modernization Project (Project) prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) and State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 §15000 et seq.). An initial Study/Negative Declaration was prepared for the Fairfax High School Major Modernization Project. Environmental review of the Project found that there would be no significant impacts as a result of construction and operation of the Project.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education (Board) approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary at Fairfax High School (Fairfax HS or Campus) for a major modernization project (Board Report No. 85-21/22). Subsequently, on January 14, 2025, the Board approved the Design-Build Contract Award to Pinner Construction Co., Inc. in partnership with DLR Group Inc. for the major modernization project (Board Report No. 100-24/25) with a contract value of $142,998,000.The proposed Project is located on a 23.63-acre school campus at 7850 Melrose Avenue within the City of Los Angeles (Board District 4, Region West). Fairfax High School (School) originally opened in 1924. All existing buildings were constructed between 1923 and 2011. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the school served approximately 1,500 students in grades 9 through 12. The proposed Project includes the construction of a new gymnasium, five specialty classrooms, outdoor physical education courts, and maintenance and operations (M&O) facilities. The new two-story gymnasium building includes team rooms and locker rooms; a public entrance and lobby providing access to the building from the west parking area along Fairfax Avenue; and five new classrooms that will host Ceramics, Drama, Instrumental Music, Sports Medicine, and Dance classes. The outdoor physical education courts will be comprised of basketball/volleyball courts, adjacent areas with trees and seating. Demolition activities will include the removal of the Shop Building, Gymnasium, M&O Building, Ticket Office, and Relocatable Sanitary Building, including foundations and below-grade and above-grade utility infrastructure associated with these buildings and structures. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impacts during construction. Additional improvements encompass exterior painting of all remaining buildings to provide a uniform appearance; associated landscape, hardscape, parking improvements, and related infrastructure upgrades including a new electrical transformer. The site is not on any hazardous waste lists under Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. A Preliminary Environmental Assessment-Equivalent (PEA-E) was prepared for the proposed Project in accordance with Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) guidelines. The PEA-E did not identify any hazardous substances in the soil, and No Further Action was recommended for the site assessment investigation. However, the site is in a designated City of Los Angeles Methane Zone, and a methane assessment has been performed. Methane monitoring and mitigation components, as required by the City of Los Angeles, will be incorporated as a part of the project design. The District’s Office of Environmental Health & Safety (OEHS) evaluated the proposed Project to determine its potential impact on the environment in accordance with CEQA, Public Resources Code §21000, et seq., and State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations §15000 et seq. Environmental review of the Project found that there would be no significant impacts as a result of construction and operation of the Project with the implementation of LAUSD’s Standard Conditions of Approval. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of a ND (State Clearinghouse Number 2025050380). The District circulated the IS/ND for a 30-day public review period from May 7, 2025, to June 6, 2025. Copies of the IS/ND and PEA-E were available for review electronically on the OEHS website and on the State Clearinghouse website and printed copies were made available for public review at OEHS District Headquarters at Beaudry and at Fairfax High School. The District posted the Notice of Intent to Adopt a Negative Declaration (NOI) on the OEHS website during the public review period, mailed the NOI to all owner/occupants located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Project site, to parents/guardians of students, and published the NOI in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The District filed the NOI with the Los Angeles County Clerk and with the State Clearinghouse for distribution to potentially affected state agencies, local agencies, tribal agencies pursuant to AB 52, and known interested parties. At the end of the public review period, the District received comment letters from two agencies and verbal comments from individuals during the community meeting. All letters and verbal comments were responded to by the District and are included in the attached Responses to Comments (RTC). The requirements set forth in the CEQA Guidelines Section 15073.5 regarding recirculation are not met.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will review and make a determination on the attached Resolution to adopt the ND pursuant to CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This action is required for the Board to consider approval of the Project. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote to adopt the Negative Declaration would enable the Board to consider approval of the Project. 
 
A “No” vote to adopt the Negative Declaration would prevent the Board from approving the proposed Project, and the proposed Project could not proceed into construction.
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy. This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). On August 24, 2021, the Board adopted an update to the SUP to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework and approved the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) to help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals (Board Report No. 027-21/22). The Implementation Plan included, among other things, the development of seven major modernization projects, one in each Board District and the Project is in Board District 4. 
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed Project, once completed, will help ensure that the students attending the school are provided with a safe and healthy environment, and up-to-date facilities that promote learning. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In 2016, the Board authorized a proposal by Arts Fairfax to donate a new 3,300 square foot art gallery and classroom building (Gallery Building) at the School, consisting of an exhibition/classroom space, office space, conference room, storage, and restrooms. Additionally, the Board authorized the inclusion of the Gallery Building design in the construction bid documents for the Project as an add alternate. The Gallery Building scope of work was included as part of the CEQA analysis for potential environmental impacts and as referenced in the CEQA documents (IS/ND). Construction of the Gallery Building will only proceed if additional funding becomes available through future external and/or District sources.
 
Environmental review of the proposed Project found that, with the incorporation of Los Angeles Unified’s Standard Conditions and Approvals, Project Design Features, as well as all applicable state, federal, and local regulations, there would be no significant impacts as a result of the Project.
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in the State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053, and the Board shall review and consider the Negative Declaration and its supporting documents and comments.

The current project budget is $177,555,145. 2) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments to implement the proposed Project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.   3) Adopt the Office of Environmental Health and Safety's (OEHS) evaluation of the proposed Project which resulted in the preparation of a ND. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, and to permit construction activities to commence, this proposed action may only be considered after the Board adopts the ND prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project (Board Report No. 041-25/26). endBodyBackground: On October 12, 2021, the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified) Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary at Fairfax High School (School or Campus) for a major modernization project. Subsequently, on June 13, 2023 the Board approved the redefinition of the Project to include the full scope, schedule, and budget to complete the Project, and on January 14, 2025 approved the Design-Build Contract Award to Pinner Construction Co., Inc. in partnership with DLR Group Inc. with a contract value of $142,998,000. Fairfax High School is located on a 23.63-acre school campus at 7850 Melrose Avenue within the City of Los Angeles (Board District 4, Region West). The School originally opened in 1924. All existing buildings were constructed between 1923 and 2011. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the school served approximately 1,500 students in grades 9 through 12.   The proposed Project includes the construction of a new gymnasium, five specialty classrooms, outdoor physical education courts, and maintenance and operations (M&O) facilities. The new two-story gymnasium building includes team rooms and locker rooms; a public entrance and lobby providing access to the building from the west parking area along Fairfax Avenue; and five new classrooms that will host Ceramics, Drama, Instrumental Music, Sports Medicine, and Dance classes. The outdoor physical education courts will be comprised of basketball/volleyball courts, adjacent areas with trees and seating. Demolition activities will include the removal of the Shop Building, Gymnasium, M&O Building, Ticket Office, and Relocatable Sanitary Building, including foundations and below-grade and above-grade utility infrastructure associated with these buildings and structures. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impacts during construction.Additional improvements encompass exterior painting of all remaining buildings to provide a uniform appearance; associated landscape, hardscape, parking improvements, and related infrastructure upgrades including a new electrical transformer.Expected Outcomes:Approval of the proposed Project will permit construction activities to be undertaken once the Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval is secured. Construction activities are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2026 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 2029.  Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of staff's proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured. If the proposed action is not adopted, staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities. As a result, the School will continue to operate with aging, deteriorating, and outdated buildings and grounds. Furthermore, students, staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project.Policy Implications: This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.Budget Impact: The proposed action does not have a budget impact as the Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it approved the Project definition and authorized the design-build contract award. The current budget for the proposed Project is $177,555,145. The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.   Student Impact: The proposed Project will help ensure that approximately 1,500 existing and future students attending the School are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.Equity Impact:The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified's reliance on relocatable buildings, and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the proposed Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows Los Angeles Unified to reach more schools with the limited funding available.Issues and Analysis: OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of the ND. The ND was circulated for a 30-day public review period from May 7, 2025, to June 6, 2025. The analysis documented in the IS/ND found that the proposed Project would not result in significant environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction, the Board must adopt the ND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project.   In 2016, the Board authorized a proposal by Arts Fairfax to donate a new 3,300 square foot art gallery and classroom building (Gallery Building) at the School, consisting of an exhibition/classroom space, office space, conference room, storage, and restrooms. Additionally, the Board authorized the inclusion of the Gallery Building design in the construction bid documents for the Project as an add alternate. The Gallery Building scope of work was included as part of the CEQA analysis for potential environmental impacts and as referenced in the CEQA documents (IS/ND). Construction of the Gallery Building will only proceed if additional funding becomes available through future external and/or District sources.Attachments:NoneSubmitted:08/26/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Four Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends to approve four Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) Projects totaling $650,000 at four elementary schools (Latona Avenue, Oxnard, San Antonio, and Van Nuys) and authorize staff to execute all necessary implementation instruments.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve four SEEDS Projects at Latona Avenue Elementary School, Oxnard Elementary School, San Antonio Elementary School, and Van Nuys Elementary School (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for the four proposed Projects is $650,000.
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive, Chief Procurement Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed SEEDS Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The SEEDS Program supports the development of projects that will enhance school sites by creating outdoor learning spaces in collaboration with school-based and community-led efforts (Program). There are two components to the Program:
 
1.                     Development of the outdoor learning space constructed by Los Angeles Unified includes capital investments, such as asphalt removal, installation of irrigation and utilities, and any associated testing and inspection.
 
2.                     Collaboration with a school site and/or partner organization that will outfit the outdoor learning space with the plant materials and landscaping features that align with the school’s instructional vision and program. This component is essential to the success of each project.
 
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school site by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit a SEEDS application to receive up to $100,000 to create or improve an outdoor learning space. An additional $50,000 is available to schools ranked in the top 150 on the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index of schools in need of green space as published in August 2022 (Greening Index).
 
The Greening Index ranks the four schools as follows: Latona Avenue Elementary School (356), Oxnard Elementary School (104), San Antonio Elementary School (204), and Van Nuys Elementary School (310). Therefore, Oxnard Elementary School is eligible for the additional $50,000 allocation.
 
District staff evaluates the proposals based on the specific criteria and requirements outlined in the SEEDS Program Guide to ensure each proposal meets the eligibility requirements. Proposals must include a written project narrative describing the project scope, an explanation of how the project will be integrated into the school’s curriculum, and confirmation of the availability of resources to outfit and maintain the outdoor learning space. The recommended Projects included in this Board Report have been reviewed and have been found to comply with the program requirements, including feasibility and equitable distribution throughout the District.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 4, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this proposed action will enable staff to proceed with the design and construction of these four proposed Projects. Approval of these greening Projects will improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff, increase sustainability, and enhance the outdoor school environment.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to execute these proposed Projects that support educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science. If these proposed projects are not approved, the school sites will not benefit from the creation of these outdoor learning spaces.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The action is also aligned with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 2 Joy and Wellness Welcoming Learning Environments by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined project budget for the four proposed Projects is $650,000. The Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked in the School Upgrade Program (SUP), specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
The project budget for Latona Avenue Elementary School includes a contribution of $200,000 from Bond Program funds earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 2 which will be transferred to funds earmarked in the SUP for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed SEEDS projects at Latona Avenue Elementary School, Oxnard Elementary School, San Antonio Elementary School, and Van Nuys Elementary School will provide outdoor learning spaces that create environments for student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. These SEEDS learning gardens will facilitate educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science, and may also be used during recess and lunchtime by approximately 1,300 current and future students. These proposed Projects also encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces.
 
Equity Impact:
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit an application for a SEEDS project for up to $100,000. Schools ranked in the top 150 on the Greening Index will receive an additional $50,000 for their SEEDS project. One of the four proposed Projects included in this Board Report qualifies for this additional funding.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In order to ensure the long-term permanence of each SEEDS project, the school site and/or its partner organization must enter into a Maintenance Agreement that provides for the ongoing maintenance of the proposed outdoor learning space.

description
(Annual Report of the Los Angeles Unified School District Proposition 28: The Arts and Music in Schools Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act) Recommends approval of the Annual Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Report for 2024-2025. The Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Funding Annual Report is a compliance requirement for each Local Education Agency (LEA) that provides narrative and quantitative details relevant to visual and performing arts base funding and Prop 28 funding, categorical state funds, which serve to supplement visual and performing arts instruction.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the annual Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Annual Report for 2024-2025
 
Body
Background: 
On November 8, 2022, California voters approved Proposition 28: The Arts and Music in Schools (AMS) Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act. The measure required the State to establish a new, ongoing program supporting arts instruction in schools beginning in 2023-24 school year. The funding is allocated to school sites based on student enrollment and academic need and, as authorized by the ballot initiative, school sites have three fiscal years to spend each school year’s allocation of funds they receive.
 
The ballot initiative allocates one percent of kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) portion of the Proposition 98 funding guarantee provided in the prior fiscal year, excluding funding appropriated for the AMS education program. Local educational agencies (LEAs) with 500 or more students are required to ensure that at least 80 percent of AMS funds are used to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education program instruction. The remaining funds must be used for training, supplies, materials, and arts educational partnership programs, with no more than one percent of funds received to be used for an LEA’s administrative expenses.  
 
One of the conditions to receive Proposition 28 funds is that “a local educational agency shall annually submit an annual board- or body- approved report in a manner determined by the Superintendent, that shall be posted on the local educational agency and department’s internet websites and that details the type of arts education programs funded by the program, the number of full-time equivalent teachers, classified personnel, teaching aides, the number of pupils served, and the number of school sites providing arts education programs with those funds.”
 
Los Angeles Unified increased its total Arts budget to $231 million in 2024-2025, inclusive of both the District and our Affiliated Charters. Of that $231 million, $101.5 million came from Proposition 28 funds (including carryover from prior entitlements). Proposition 28 funds are allocated to all LAUSD schools serving K-12 students. In the 2024-2025 school year, these funds were allocated to fund approximately 368.41 teachers, 49.57 teacher assistants, and 22.19 classified positions (excluding affiliated charter staffing). 
 
Proposition 28 stipulates that funds be used to increase funding of arts education programs within school districts. While this may differ school-to-school, the law assesses the overall expenditures and investments at the District level. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Increased Proposition 28 funding will result in expanded student access to dance, music, theatre, visual arts and media arts/film instruction during the school day. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board of Education does not approve this annual report, Proposition 28 funds may be delayed or withheld for the 2025-26 school year.
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
For the 2024-2025 school year, Los Angeles Unified and its Affiliated Charters received approximately $72 million in new Proposition 28 funding, in addition to the carryover from the 2023-24 entitlement. Please note that the fiscal year 2025 entitlement was finalized in June. The annual state budget appropriation is subject to change year by year, depending on the overall Proposition 98 funds available each fiscal year. 
 
Student Impact:
By providing additional funds to support arts education, the District anticipates increased student achievement outcomes and enhanced social emotional development.

Resolved further, That in a climate of escalating xenophobia where immigrant students and families are effectively kidnapped and incarcerated in dehumanizing conditions, enduring unimaginable suffering, the District commits to provide child welfare support by assigning five Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors in each region and considering additional assignments based on need by considering the number of students and proportionate amount of ice activity in each region in a genuine effort to address immigrant students and family’s needs; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District will continue to promote attendance awareness through District websites and social media outlets, informed by the perspective of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors, as they continue to conduct home visits, bring students back to school, and re-engage families to strengthen child welfare in our communities.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Whereas, Unlawful financial practices burden low-income communities the most and trap families with inescapable debt;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities suffer the most from bank deserts, communities with limited or no banking institutions, that pressure their residents to rely on payday lenders or other companies that offer money loans with high-interest rates;
 
Whereas, Studies show that the borrowing amount, annual percentage rate, or rejection of a home loan has been historically tied to systemic racism, also known as redlining, resulting in harsher loan terms for minority communities despite having similar financial outcomes as their non-minority counterparts;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities have lower opportunities to establish generational wealth, with Hispanic communities having a median household income of $62,800 and African-American communities holding $52,860 in median household income, below the national median of $74,580 according to a 2022 United States Census Bureau report;

Whereas, Financial literacy may be provided to high school seniors and their families through specific courses, at specific schools, and through family academy; now, therefore, be it

Body
 
description
Whereas, The United States has observed Latino/a/e Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 since 1988 to commemorate the contributions, heritage, achievements, and cultural influences of Latino Americans in the United States;
 
Whereas, Latine Heritage Month also recognizes the intersectionality and diversity of the U.S. Latine population, incorporating indigenous histories and celebrating the independence days of several Latin American countries including: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua;
 
Whereas, Latinos also include people of African and indigenous descent who are too often ignored when talking about the history, culture, and contributions of Latin American peoples, despite making up about 10% of U.S. Latinos;
 
Whereas, This month-long recognition serves as an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about Latine history, promote cultural awareness and inclusivity, and celebrate diversity both in the present and in our nation’s history;
 
Whereas, U.S. imperialism and military intervention in Latin America, including in countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, and Nicaragua, has led to mass migration of people fleeing civil wars and economic hardship to the United States;
 
Whereas, The U.S. Latine population has grown to become the second largest racial or ethnic group in the United States in the last decade, reaching 62.6 million Latinos as of 2021 and accounting for 19% of all Americans;
 
Whereas, The state of California is home to the largest Latine population in the country, where they comprise 40.3% of the state’s overall population, and almost 50% of the population of the County of Los Angeles;
 
Whereas, Communities like Pico-Union, Boyle Heights, Koreatown, South East Los Angeles, Pacoima, San Fernando, and others are the traditional neighborhoods in Los Angeles of immigrant Latine students and their families;
 
Whereas, Latine students comprise almost 78% of the Los Angeles Unified School District student population, underscoring the importance and relevance of Latine Heritage Month among the District’s students and families;
 
Whereas, Recognizing and celebrating Latine Heritage Month as a District furthers the work of our Strategic Plan to provide culturally relevant, empowering curriculum that inspires students to become leaders and advocates for their communities;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to supporting newcomer students and multilingual learners (MLLs), through the establishment of newcomer programs across the District, including international newcomer academies, that are intended to serve students enrolled in U.S. schools for 3 years or less;
 
Whereas, The District is committed, above and beyond this commemoration, to empowering students through culturally responsive and inclusive learning environments that celebrates the value and diversity of all its students;
 
Whereas, In the current national climate, recognizing and honoring Latine communities is even more critical, as families face intensified attacks on public education and anti-immigrant rhetoric, violent raids, and policies that threaten the safety and full participation of Latino and immigrant students and families;
 
Whereas, Ethnic Studies programs are culturally responsive programs that include the study of Latine history, culture, and contributions, but have come under increasing attack from those championing a sanitized version of American history, threatening the ability of students to access inclusive and empowering curriculum;
 
Whereas, Spanish language instruction plays a critical role in preserving cultural heritage, fostering bilingualism and biliteracy, and supporting students’ academic and social-emotional success, yet is at risk in the face of policy and funding pressures;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes and celebrates that a significant number of Latine students are indigenous, with many speaking indigenous languages reflecting the cultural and linguistic diversity within the Latine community;
 
Whereas, The experiences of Latine students are impacted by their family’s economic status, with low-income Latine students historically facing some of the widest educational disparities; 
 
Whereas, The current political climate has seen an unprecedented and often violent increase in anti-immigrant enforcement actions, policy proposals, and rhetoric that directly impact Latino students, families, and communities, creating fear and barriers to full participation in public education; and
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District remains committed to its status as a sanctuary district, implementing policies and practices that protect immigrant students and families from discrimination, harassment, and enforcement actions on school grounds in addition to providing resources and direct support for those impacted; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes and celebrates September 15 through October 15 as Latino Heritage Month; 
 
Resolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will work to promote educational resources on Latine history, culture, and heritage and make them widely available to staff, students, and families online through the Los Angeles Unified School District homepage and social media accounts; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to fully implement and protect Ethnic Studies curriculum that reflects the histories, struggles, and contributions of Latine communities, recognizing it as a critical component of a well-rounded education for all students; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board affirms that, given the large percentage  of Latine students in LAUSD, Latine history, experiences, and contributions should be integrated and embedded in all areas of the curricula and at all ages, not just during Latine Heritage Month or in Ethnic Studies, and that the District should, therefore, strive to support educators to do so; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board recognizes the importance of Spanish language instruction as both a core academic subject and a cultural bridge for our diverse communities, and commits to protecting and expanding high-quality, culturally affirming Spanish language programs amid current pressures and threats to bilingual education, as well as continued efforts to foster the inclusion of and improve supports for students and families who are primarily speakers of indigenous languages;

Resolved, That by adoption of this resolution, the Board and Superintendent hereby encourage all students, staff, and families, to commemorate and celebrate the immense historical and cultural contributions that Latine people have made and continue to make here in Los Angeles, California, and the United States particularly in light of the targeted assaults this community faces today.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Body
Background: 
Education Code Section 42100 requires the District to submit an annual statement of all receipts and expenditures for all funds of the preceding fiscal year to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) on or before September 15th.
 
Under Education Code Section 42132, the District must also adopt a resolution identifying an estimated appropriations limit for the current year and an actual appropriations limit for the preceding year. The so- called “Gann Initiative” places limits on the growth of expenditures for publicly funded programs.
 
Although the Gann Limit calculations are provided as part of the Unaudited Actuals Report, a specific resolution is required by statute.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The District’s statement of revenues and expenditures (Unaudited Actuals) for Fiscal Year 2024-25 shall be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools in compliance with Education Code 42100. The budget beginning balance for the current fiscal year (2025-26) shall be updated based on the Unaudited Actuals report.
 
The adopted Gann Limit Resolution shall be presented to the public.
 
Board Options and Consequences:
Board approval and filing of the Unaudited Actuals Report and the adoption of the Gann Limit Resolution are statutorily mandated. 
 
A “Yes” vote, would allow the District to comply with the requirements of Ed Code by submitting the required report and resolution.
 
A “No” vote, shall cause the District to be non- compliant with the requirements of Ed Code.
 
Policy Implications:
None.
 
Budget Impact:
Fiscal Year 2025-26 carryover balances for schools and offices shall be adjusted based on updated actual ending balances from the prior fiscal year and in accordance with current carryover policies.
 
Student Impact:

Unaudited Actuals are an annual statement reporting on the financial activities of the District prior to audit.

Issues and Analysis:
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the District was able to meet its financial commitments and required ending balances, as set forth in the District’s Budget and Finance Policy. The Unaudited Actuals resulted in a General Fund unassigned balance of $2,011 million, which is $96 million higher than projected in Estimated Actuals. This shall be considered in the Budget for fiscal year 2025-26. 
 
The Fiscal Stabilization Plan will be updated at first interim to account for the $96 million. Additionally, the Unaudited Actuals reflect the Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) original assumptions included in the adopted 2025-26 Budget.  The updated OPEB assumption changes presented at budget adoption on June 24, 2025, will also be reflected at first interim. Additionally, the Classroom Expense Actuals (CEA) form includes manual adjustments beyond the automated adjustments to more accurately reflect the percentage of District classroom expenditures. The District shall continue to monitor spending and explore strategies to maximize revenues and maintain a balanced budget.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista is a TK-8 school currently serving 464 students on two private facilities at 11561 Gateway Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 and 11518 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 in Board District 4 and Region West. Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 7, 2012.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 125-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for ICEF Vista Middle Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 375 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term. The school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 500 to 375 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
ICEF Vista Middle Academy is a 6-8 school currently serving 192 students on a private facility at 5456 McConnell Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90066 in Board District 4 and Region West. ICEF Vista Middle Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 26, 2007.  On September 12, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 500 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for ICEF Vista Middle Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, ICEF Vista Middle Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.  
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current ICEF Vista Middle Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 133, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc.) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc., a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 300 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 300 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term.  The school is requesting to decrease enrollment from 600 to 300 to align with the school’s enrollment trends.  The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. is a 9-12 high school currently serving 120 students on a District site at 4120 11th Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90008 in Board District 1 and Region South. CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 11, 2003.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 600 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 20, 2025, CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 124-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
Extera Public School No. 2 is a TK-5 school currently serving 108 students on a District Prop. 39 co-location at 4112 E. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90023 in Board District 2 and Region East.

If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Equitas Academy 5) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Equitas Academy 5, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 500 students in grades TK-4 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Equitas Academy 5 (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 500 students in grades TK-4 in each year of the charter term.   The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Equitas Academy 5 is a TK-4 school currently serving 178 students on a private facility at 1612 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90015 in Board District 5 and Region West. Equitas Academy 5 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Equitas Academy 5 expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 20, 2025, Equitas Academy 5 submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Equitas Academy 5 governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 127-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

Body
Background: 
High Tech LA is a 9-12 school currently serving 351 students on the Lake Balboa Education Complex at 17111 Victory Blvd., Van Nuys, CA, 91406 in Board District 3 and Region North. High Tech LA was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 11, 2003, as a start-up affiliated charter school. The charter was renewed by the Board of Education on April 8, 2008, as a conversion independent charter school. Most recently, on December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 415 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for High Tech LA expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, High Tech LA submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.

Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District.

If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for High Tech LA Middle (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 450 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
High Tech LA Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 277 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-Location site at 5041 Sunnyslope Avenue, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91423 in Board District 3 and Region North. High Tech LA Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on May 9, 2017. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for High Tech LA Middle expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, High Tech LA Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current High Tech LA Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 130, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
Magnolia Science Academy 4 is a 6-12 span school currently serving 124 students on a District campus at 11330 W. Graham Place, Room B-9, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 in Board District 4 and Region West.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Pacoima Charter Elementary (“Charter School”), a Conversion Independent charter school, located in Board District 6 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 1,300 students in grades TK-6 in each year of the charter term. The school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 1,528 to 1,300 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Pacoima Charter Elementary is a TK-6 school currently serving 832 students on a District Site Pacoima Charter Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 22, 2003 at 11016 Norris Avenue, Pacoima, CA, 91331 in Board District 6 and Region North. On May 1, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 1,308 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Pacoima Charter Elementary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 20, 2025, Pacoima Charter Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025. 
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Pacoima Charter Elementary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 138, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution. 
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
Rise Kohyang Elementary is a TK-5 elementary school currently serving 302 students on a private facility at 600 S. La Fayette Park Place, Los Angeles, CA, 90057 in Board District 2 and Region East. Rise Kohyang Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on December 5, 2017.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Stella Middle Charter Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 1 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 560 students in grades 5-8 in each year of the charter term. The school is requesting to decrease enrollment from 750 to 560 to align with the school’s enrollment trends.  The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Stella Middle Charter Academy is a 5-8 span school currently serving 481 students on a private facility at 4301 West Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90008 in Board District 1 and Region West. Stella Middle Charter Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 11, 2003.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 750 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Stella Middle Charter Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Stella Middle Charter Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Stella Middle Charter Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 141-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for STEM Preparatory Elementary (“Charter School”), to add an additional site. The proposed site is located at 1371 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
STEM Preparatory Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 316 students on a private facility at 1374 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. STEM Preparatory Elementary was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017.
 
On August 21, 2025, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of STEM Preparatory Elementary’s complete material revision. STEM Preparatory Elementary seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2026.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.                     
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Valley International Preparatory High (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 400 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term.

Body
Background: 
Valley International Preparatory High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 291 students on a private facility at 18827 Roscoe Blvd., Northridge, CA, 91324 in Board District 3 and Region North. Valley International Preparatory High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education December 5, 2017. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Valley International Preparatory High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Valley International Preparatory High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Valley International Preparatory High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 144-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues.

Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Valor Academy High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 507 students on a private facility at 9356 Lemona Avenue, North Hills, CA, 91343 in Board District 6 and Region North. Valor Academy High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 19, 2013.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 480 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Valor Academy High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Valor Academy High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.

Current Valor Academy High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.

Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 145-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Wallis Annenberg High (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 600 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Wallis Annenberg High is a 9-12 school currently serving 483 students on a District site pursuant to a lease agreement at 4000 S. Main St., Los Angeles, CA, 90037 in Board District 5 and Region East. Wallis Annenberg High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 25, 2003.  On March 6, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 600 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Wallis Annenberg High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Wallis Annenberg High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Wallis Annenberg High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 146-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in the area of academics (ELPI), located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 370 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.

Body
Background: 
ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 245 students on a private facility at 5029 S. Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90037 in Board District 1 and Region South. ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on July 8, 2008.  On September 12, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August, 21, 2025, ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.

The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 131, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for City Language Immersion Charter (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school with benchmarks in the areas of academics (ELA for English Learners; and ELPI), located in Board District 1 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 432 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
City Language Immersion Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 358 students on a private facility at 4001 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90019 in Board District 1 and Region West. City Language Immersion Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 432 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for City Language Immersion Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, City Language Immersion Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current City Language Immersion Charter governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 126-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues.

Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Body
Background: 
Camino Nuevo High #2 is a 9-12 high school currently serving 504 students on a private facility at 3500 W. Temple Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90004 in Board District 2 and Region East. Camino Nuevo High #2 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 19, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 500 students in grades 9-12.

All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for New Los Angeles Charter) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for New Los Angeles Charter, a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in the area of academics (ELA for Students with Disabilities), located in Board District 1 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 360 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for New Los Angeles Charter (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in the area of academics (ELA for Students with Disabilities), located in Board District 1 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 360 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
New Los Angeles Charter is a 6-8 school currently serving 320 students on a private facility at 1919 S. Burnside Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90016 in Board District 1 and Region West. New Los Angeles Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 22, 2008.  On October 3, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 360 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Los Angeles Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, New Los Angeles Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current New Los Angeles Charter governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 137, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Denial of the Renewal Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 270 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Ingenium Charter Middle (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region North, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Ingenium Charter Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 195 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-Location (Sutter Middle School) at 7330 Winnetka Avenue, Winnetka, CA, 91306 in Board District 4 and Region North.  Ingenium Charter Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 12, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 270 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Ingenium Charter Middle expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 20, 2025, Ingenium Charter Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and/or 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current Ingenium Charter Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Ingenium Charter Middle and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607, and/or 47607.2, and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 134-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language.  
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

(Denial of the Renewal Petition for Matrix for Success Academy) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for Matrix for Success Academy, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board Districts 5 and 2 and Region East.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Matrix for Success Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board Districts 5 and 2 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Matrix for Success Academy is a 9-12 span school currently serving 274 students on private facilities at 1010 E. 34th St., Los Angeles, CA, 90011 and 700 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA, 90017 in Board Districts 5 and 2 and Region East, respectively. Matrix for Success Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 13, 2017.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Matrix for Success Academy expires June 30, 2026. Matrix for Success Academy was designated by the State as a Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS) school in July of 2019.
 
On August 21, 2025, Matrix for Success Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and/or 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current for Matrix for Success Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Paragraph (2) and subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 47607.2 [the “middle” and “low” performing criteria for renewal and grounds for nonrenewal] do not apply to charter schools that are eligible for alternate methods for calculating the state and local indicators pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 52064.5. (Ed. Code, § 47607(c)(7).) These charter schools are designated as Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS).  In determining whether to grant a charter renewal for such a charter school, the chartering authority shall consider, in addition to the charter school's performance on the state and local indicators included in the evaluation rubrics adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 52064.5, the charter school's performance on alternative metrics applicable to the charter school based on the pupil population served.  
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Matrix for Success Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined closure of Charter School is in the best interest of pupils.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 136, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  is a 6-8 school currently serving 309 students on a private facility at 8001 Santa Fe Avenue, Walnut Park, CA, 90255 in Board District 5 and Region East. PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013. On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 504 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, PREPA TEC - Los Angeles submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and/or 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current PREPA TEC - Los Angeles governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.

Code, § 47607(e).); and Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Ed. Code, § 47607(c).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education.

If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 139-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

(Strengthening Career Technical Education Act (Perkins V) Grant). Recommends ratifying the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins V) grant for the 2025-2026 fiscal year in the amount of $7,141,552.00. The Perkins V grant provides federal funding to enhance and expand Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, ensuring that students acquire the academic, technical, and employability skills necessary for success in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand careers. The grant emphasizes equity and access by modernizing CTE programs to serve all students across middle and high schools. Perkins V also supports strong partnerships among schools, industry, and postsecondary institutions to align education with workforce needs, while promoting innovation, program improvement, and accountability. Currently, 149 schools access CTE services through Perkins funding. Annual ratification by the Board is required to authorize the distribution of these funds and ensure the continued delivery of CTE services to participating schools.

end
 
Body
Background: 
This annual federal reimbursement entitlement grant provides LAUSD with funds to strengthen and enhance the Career Technical Education (CTE) program. Per the California Department of Education (CDE). Students in CTE pathways have higher attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and increased post-secondary enrollment rates.
 
The schools receiving the grant, applied for the grant and were selected based on their application responses and evidence of meeting the essential elements of high quality [1) student-centered delivery of services, 2) equity, and access, 3) skilled instruction and educational leadership, 6) career exploration and student support, 7) appropriate use of data and continuous improvement, 8) cross-system alignment, 9) intentional recruitment and marketing, 10) sustained investments and funding through mutual agreements, and 11) strong partnerships with industry] CTE programs.
 
Grant funds will support CTE teachers from 149 schools across all regions in professional development targeting special populations including emergent bilingual students, special needs students, and economically disadvantaged students.
 
The grant funds are used to purchase equipment and materials for CTE pathways to ensure pathways have industry-standard equipment.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:

o                     Completing CTE pathways and transitioning to post-secondary institutions to advance their skills for careers of their choice
o                     Provide pathways with industry-standard equipment and materials
•                     Provide pathways with industry-standard equipment and materials
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If ratified, Career and Technical Education (CTE) students will have access to allowable purchases funded through the Perkins V grant. If not ratified, the District and its CTE students will forfeit $7,141,552.00 in grant funding, resulting in the discontinuation of CTE programs within the District.
 
Policy Implications: 
None
 
Budget Impact: 
None. There are no match requirements for this grant.
 
Student Impact:
•                     Career exploration and guidance opportunities for students
•                     Pathway alignment with community colleges
•                     Increase CTE Courses with dual enrollment by accelerating the time to completion
•                     Access to a continuum of work-based learning activities
•                     Increased attainment of industry-specific technical skills, certifications, and training

(Adoption of Textbooks for Advanced Placement History/Social Science Courses)  Recommends adoption of Textbooks for Advanced Placement History/Social Science Courses and approval of the updated instructional materials for nine Advanced Placement History/Social Science courses and authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to negotiate and execute five-year textbook purchase agreements, not to exceed $6.6 million, within existing program budgets.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Approve the adoption of instructional materials outlined for use in the nine (9) Advanced Placement (AP) History/Social Science courses listed in Attachment A; and
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer to negotiate and execute five-year textbook purchase agreements, in a not-to-exceed amount of $6.6 million, funded within existing program budgets, will be presented to the Board of Education (Board) for ratification, likely in Spring 2026.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The California State Board of Education (SBE) reviews and adopts instructional materials for kindergarten through grade eight. Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, school districts may also select instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, including for grades nine through twelve, provided the materials align with State standards and are reviewed by a majority of classroom teachers in the relevant subject area or grade level.
 
Los Angeles Unified’s current Advanced Placement (AP) History textbooks include two courses adopted in Fall 2017 and six courses adopted in Fall 2018, with copyright dates ranging from 2015 to 2018. Since those adoptions, the College Board has revised and updated several AP courses and corresponding exams. One course-AP Comparative Government-does not currently have an adopted textbook.
 
To address these needs, Library & Textbook Support solicited submissions from multiple publishers for the courses listed in Attachment A. Evaluation committees, composed of teachers currently teaching the respective AP courses, conducted a rigorous review of the submitted materials. Collectively, these educators represent more than 673 years of teaching experience across all four Regions of the District. The committees applied established criteria, including alignment with College Board Course and Exam Descriptions, consistency with SBE-adopted content standards, program organization, assessment, universal access, and instructional planning with teacher support. Based on this review, the committees identified and recommended the instructional materials that best meet the learning needs of Los Angeles Unified students.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Board adoption of the instructional materials recommended for use in the District will result in students having textbooks aligned with the State standards and/or Advanced Placement requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the recommended instructional materials will:
•                     Ensure that instructional content for AP History/Social Science courses aligns with the current College Board frameworks and expectations.
•                     Provide students with high-quality, accurate, and culturally responsive resources that support rigorous AP coursework.
•                     Enhance student preparedness and performance on AP exams, improving opportunities for college credit and advanced standing.
•                     Support teachers with updated, standards-aligned instructional tools and professional learning materials.
 
If the Board of Education does not adopt the recommended instructional materials, students will be required to continue using the currently adopted textbooks-or, in some cases, have no adopted textbooks at all, depending on the course. This would result in students relying on outdated resources that are not aligned with the current College Board Advanced Placement (AP) course frameworks and exams. Such misalignment could place students at a disadvantage in both AP coursework and exam readiness, potentially impacting their academic performance and college credit opportunities.
 
Policy Implications: 
The policy of targeting state funding to implement adoptions is consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board of Education.
 
Budget Impact: 
General Fund and Lottery apportionment from the State are the budgeting expenditures for textbooks, 4000 - object code. The aggregate not-to-exceed cost of the proposed textbook adoption for instructional materials to support nine courses is $6.6 million, covering five years, with the majority in year one due to the purchase of non-consumable hardcover textbooks. This adoption will be accommodated within existing program budgets.
 
Student Impact:
Updated Advanced Placement textbooks are designed to align with the most current Advanced Placement curriculum and exam format, ensuring our students are prepared for the Advanced Placement exams, which take place every Spring. The availability of these Advanced Placement textbooks underscores our commitment to equitable access to superior educational resources, regardless of students' individual circumstances or available resources.

Score Rationale



Recognition

      3

Although the Advanced Placement (AP) textbooks are published for a national audience rather than specifically for California, publishers have made notable progress in incorporating authentic voices and addressing historical inequities within their content. To further advance educational equity, the District will continue to supplement adopted textbooks with culturally relevant and responsive instructional materials developed by the District and its educational partners. These supplemental resources will help ensure that instruction not only aligns with College Board frameworks but also reflects the diverse histories, perspectives, and experiences of Los Angeles Unified students and communities.



Resource Prioritization

      1

The proposed textbooks will be issued to every student enrolled in the appropriate course, regardless of need. In order to meet Williams Sufficiency requirements, all students, regardless of need, are entitled to a textbook appropriate for their course. These textbooks comply with Education Code requirements.



Results

      3

Providing all students with access to quality Advanced Placement textbooks ensures that they have access to the same high-level educational resources, regardless of their school's location or funding. The recommended books have the content and the resources to close achievement gaps when implemented in concert with culturally responsive pedagogy.

Brief Description:
(Adopt Resolution Certifying Los Angeles Unified School District’s Compliance with California Education Code § 8973) Recommends adoption of a Board Resolution certifying that Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD, Los Angeles Unified, or District) extended-day kindergarten program meets the statutory criteria in California Education Code § 8973 (EC 8973).
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached Board of Education resolution (Exhibit A) declaring LAUSD compliance with California Education Code Section 8973 requirements.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Los Angeles Unified secured $4,459,128 through Office of the Public School Construction’s (OPSC) California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program (Grant) to supplement funding for the Amestoy Elementary School Classroom Replacement Project for the construction of three transitional kindergarten classrooms and three full-day kindergarten classrooms (Project). As a condition of this funding, LAUSD must submit a Board Resolution affirming compliance with Education Code § 8973, which allows kindergarten within an early primary program to exceed four hours (exclusive of recesses) provided the day does not exceed the length of the primary grade day and the program offers ample opportunities for both active and quiet, developmentally appropriate instruction. While LAUSD currently operates an extended-day kindergarten program that meets these criteria, the required Board Resolution certifying compliance has not yet been adopted.
 
Transitional Kindergarten (TK) is part of a two-year kindergarten program. Students are placed in TK the first year and kindergarten in the second year based on age level eligibility. This program is developmentally appropriate, and standards align instruction, while providing ample opportunities for active and quiet activities as necessary.
end
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon adoption of the attached resolution, the District will be compliant with Education Code Section 8973. In addition, staff will be able to certify that the declaration requirement of the Grant has been met.
end
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the proposed resolution is not approved, the District will not be compliant with EC section 8973, and the District will be obligated to return the $4,459,128 in State grant funds already received for the Project, plus interest. The District would then need to use local bond funds to cover the loss of State funds and would become ineligible to receive other State grants for extended-day kindergarten facilities.
end
 
Policy Implications: 
Staff’s proposal also aligns with Pillar 2, Priority A (Joy and Wellness: Welcoming Learning Environments) and Pillar 4, Priority B (Operational Effectiveness: Modernizing Infrastructure) of LAUSD’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by facilitating student access to safe and healthy learning environments.
..end
 
Budget Impact: 
The Project is funded by the Grant and Bond Program funds earmarked for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. This action will not affect the Board-approved budget for the Project, but failure to pass the proposed resolution would necessitate replacement of the State Grant funds with Bond Program funds. The action does not have an impact on General Funds.
end
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this action will also allow LAUSD to comply with the requirements of the Grant, thus enabling the District to retain existing state funding and possibly receive future funding to construct new classrooms and modernize existing facilities, which will facilitate student access to safe and healthy learning environments.
end
 
Equity Impact: 
EC section 8973 allows for extended-day kindergarten programs, which can exceed the standard four-hour day, provided the district's governing board declares the extended day does not exceed the length of the primary school day and the program integrates ample time for both active and quiet activities.
end
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Adopting the resolution will bring the District into compliance with EC section 8973 for extended-day kindergarten, while supporting the implementation of the Project. It will not alter the Board-approved Project scope or alter how the District implements extended-day kindergarten.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of  award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Goods and General Services Contracts:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of  award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts, furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See Attachment C for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions) Recommends the ratification of Procurement Services Division contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts; emergency contract amendment and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including professional services contracts; architectural and engineering contracts; and environmental laboratory services contracts.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including fire life safety training and video creation services and materials testing and special inspection services contracts.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013 Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 08, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact:
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached resolution (Attachment A) regarding the Capital Facilities Fund Annual Accounting Report (Attachment B) in accordance with Government Code Sections 66000 et esq.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Education Code Section 17620 allows school districts to assess fees on residential and commercial construction within their respective boundaries when a reasonable relationship exists between the need for new or reconstructed school facilities and resident, commercial and industrial development.  These fees are paid by property owners and developers to school districts to mitigate the impact created by new development within a school district’s boundaries on the school facilities.
 
School impact fees may be used only for the (a) construction and reconstruction of school facilities, (b) costs associated with conducting any study, finding, needs analysis or determination required as part of the process to adopt the school impact fees, (c) costs for administering the fee, and (d) costs associated with conducting the meeting(s) required for levying a fee. Education Code section 17620 clarifies that the “construction or reconstruction of school facilities” does not  encompass: (a) regular maintenance or routine repair of school buildings and facilities, (b) the inspection, sampling, analysis, encapsulation, or removal of asbestos-containing materials except where incidental to school facilities construction or reconstruction, or (c) or deferred maintenance.
 
Per policy, once the costs related to administering the school impact fees and fulfilling the required analysis and reporting duties have been subtracted, the adjusted school impact fees shall be used on permissible projects that have already been approved by the Board of Education. These projects and associated funding shall be incorporated in the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) unless the project’s budget does not include bond funding.
 
Attachment C lists the FY25 expenditures for construction and reconstruction of school facilities expenditures on permissible projects that have been approved by the Board and incorporated into the Facilities SEP.
 
Per Government Code section 66000 et seq., a school district that collects school impact fees is obliged to provide an annual financial report of fees collected, including starting and ending balances, collected fee amounts, and interest earned. 
This report must be submitted within 180 days after the conclusion of each fiscal year (refer to attachments B and C).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The District shall be in compliance with Government Code Sections 66000 et seq. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board adopts the resolution on the annual accounting report, the District will comply with Government Code Sections 66000 et seq.  
 
If the Board does not adopt the resolution, the District will be out of compliance, which could affect its ability to assess school impact fees or require refunds of unspent school impact fee proceeds. 
 
Policy Implications: 
In accordance with the School Impact Fees Policy, the Chief Financial Officer is presenting the annual accounting report of the Capital Facilities Fund's beginning and ending balances, fees collected, interest and other income received, expenditures by project and refunds made for fiscal year 2025. 
 
Budget Impact: 
None
 
Student Impact:
School impact fees assessed upon new residential, commercial or industrial development projects located within District boundaries are used to provide funds for construction and reconstruction of school facilities to accommodate students generated from new development projects. School impact fees are only allocated to permissible projects that have already been approved by the Board. These projects are incorporated into the Facilities SEP unless the project’s budget does not include local bond funding. Projects funded in full or partially by School Impact Fee revenue, may provide additional capacity to accommodate an increase in students in a certain neighborhood(s) and/or provide reconstructed/modernized school facilities to ensure schools are safe and can be occupied, and that the District can maintain existing facilities levels of service for students, and has facilities in place to accommodate additional students from residential developments.

Approval of Career Technical Education Facilities Program Grant Applications
Facilities Services Division
end
 
description
Brief Description:
(Approval of Career Technical Education Facilities Program Grant Applications) Recommends approval to submit grant applications for State of California Department of Education’s Career Technical Education Facilities Program (CTEFP) Seventh Funding Cycle (Cycle 7). These are grant applications for previously Board of Education (Board) approved projects. For the four previously approved projects, the proposed applications will allow Los Angeles Unified (District) to seek additional State funding support.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve grant applications for submission in Cycle 7 of California’s CTEFP for the four Career Technical Education (CTE) programs described in Attachment A, and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments associated with the grant applications for CTEFP. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
CTEFP provides state funding to qualifying local educational agencies (LEAs) for the construction of new CTE facilities, modernization or reconfiguration of existing CTE facilities, and/or the purchase of CTE equipment with an average useful life expectancy of at least 10 years. Maximum CTEFP grants are $1.5 million for modernization projects and $3 million for new-construction projects. The CTEFP was enacted after public approval of Proposition 1D in November 2006. Current funding for the program comes from Proposition 2, a state bond measure approved by the public in November 2024 that earmarked $600 million to address the need for CTE facilities. 
 
District has identified up to four potential CTEFP applications for submission during the current Cycle 7. In accordance with CTEFP requirements, applications must be approved by the LEA’s governing board. This action will satisfy that requirement and allow the District to apply for up to $10,500,000 in state funding.
 
The seventh funding cycle for CTEFP is currently underway, and applications for this cycle are due at the California Department of Education by December 1, 2025.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will approve up to four grant applications (Attachment A), which will support the construction of new facilities, the modernization or reconfiguration of existing facilities, and/or the purchase of new equipment for CTE courses at LAUSD schools.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board approves, staff will apply for up to $10,500,000 in CTEFP funding. If the Board does not approve, the District will lose the opportunity to pursue CTEFP grant funding during the current funding cycle.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action will not change current LAUSD policy. 
 
Budget Impact: 
Participation in CTEFP provides a 50% state match for eligible costs, up to $1.5 million for each modernization/reconfiguration project and up to $3 million for each new-construction project.  The Board has already approved facility construction and equipment acquisition for the four projects named in Attachment A, with all project expenses to be paid from local bond funds.  If the Board approves the grant applications for these projects and the applications are funded, local bond funds previously allocated to these projects will become available for other projects.  This action will not affect the General Fund.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this action will allow staff to pursue grant funds for CTE projects that enhance student learning experience at comprehensive high schools by providing new and upgraded classrooms, workrooms, laboratories, studios, and equipment.  
 
Equity Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the proposed action will enable the District to submit four applications for up to $10,500,000 in state funding that would partly replace local bond funding for projects that have been previously approved by the Board.  If grant monies are not awarded, previously allocated bond funds will be used to complete these Board-approved projects.
Approval of this action does not guarantee that the District will secure CTEFP funding, but merely fulfills a submission requirement that must be met for the applications to be reviewed and scored by the California Department of Education.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 30 Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 30 critical school facility projects to replace and upgrade essential building and site systems, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $6,403,253, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of necessary equipment and materials. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 30 projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $6,403,253.  
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications, and the purchase of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Bravo Medical Magnet High School and Van Deene Elementary School along with 28 projects to provide new secure entry systems at various schools.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve 30 projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. Moreover, the proposed secure entrance projects support the Protecting Our Students and School
Sites Board Resolution.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 30 proposed Projects is $6,403,253 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. 
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 25,850 current and future students attending these 30 schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact: 
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Projects will provide outdoor classrooms by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. The intent of the proposed Projects is to create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classrooms may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging

Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board of Education will define and approve the proposed Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Projects. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and access to nature-based green space will remain limited.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the proposed Projects is $4,198,776. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each budget for the proposed Projects was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about their proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual budgets for the proposed Projects will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known and/or unforeseen conditions arise, and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each of the proposed Projects.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning to benefit approximately 440 current and future students.
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor classrooms will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
Equity Impact:
The proposed Projects were identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with Regions and school site administrators. Sites were selected based upon each center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Projects’ proposals in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Projects’ scopes will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Projects’ scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
Under the Transition Plan, each school is assigned to one of three levels of accessibility (Category One, Two, or Three) based on assessments of more than two dozen criteria including school programs, matriculation options, feeder pattern, geographic location, known (or anticipated/matriculating) population of students with disabilities or parents/guardians with disabilities, type of instructional model, and public input. The assigned category reflects the level of accessibility the site needs to meet. Schools that do not yet meet the criteria for their assigned category will undergo accessibility improvements and are prioritized for project development based on the criteria mentioned above. The three categories of accessibility are as follows: 
 
₋                     Category One: These are “key” schools and will have the highest level of access, generally in accordance with applicable physical accessibility standards. Category 1A will provide “full accessibility” for the schools that were built to new construction standards, while Category 1B will provide “high accessibility” for schools that have been altered with some limited exceptions.
 
₋                     Category Two: These will be “program-accessible” schools. The core spaces and features of these schools would be made accessible; in addition, program accessibility would be provided to all programs and activities at the school. 
 
₋                     Category Three: These schools will have “core access,” which means that the core spaces (certain common spaces) would be made accessible, to ensure a basic level of access to the building. These include, for example, parking, the main entrance and main office, assembly areas, and some restrooms.
 
The six school sites for which an accessibility enhancement project is being proposed do not yet meet their assigned category/level of accessibility and thus require facilities improvements. The scope, schedule, and budget for each proposed project reflects the existing known conditions at each school site and the improvements necessary to meet each school’s assigned category of accessibility. The conditions of significance include acreage, topography, square footage, existence of multi-story buildings, age of buildings, as well as the number of schools, programs, features, and activities at a school site. 
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit C. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit D. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve six accessibility enhancement projects as detailed in Exhibit A and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately begin designing the proposed projects at six school sites.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the six proposed accessibility enhancement projects, which are necessary to achieve program accessibility as outlined in the Transition Plan and are required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal furthers the implementation of the Transition Plan. As outlined in the Transition Plan, at Category One, Two, and Three schools, an appropriate number of classrooms will be identified to serve as accessible learning spaces, some of which may require facility improvements to meet the criteria for their assigned accessibility category. Additionally, the proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements at schools.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves. This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget, as currently estimated, for the six proposed projects is $55,059,901. The proposed projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
The six proposed projects will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 4,870 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at each campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability. As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible. While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities. These proposed projects are in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

description
Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 18 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 18 Board District Priority and Region Priority projects, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $1,101,388, and authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 18 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $1,101,388.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the schools and their students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 18 proposed projects is $1,101,388. Sixteen projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Two projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 9,500 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

description 
Brief Description: 
(Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School) Recommends approval of dedication of corner ramp easement to the City of Los Angeles. Pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Los Angeles Unified School District (“District”) and Porter Ranch Development Company, the District is contractually obligated to meet the condition of dedicating the corner cut ramp easement at the intersection of Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue to the City of Los Angeles (“City”) to use as a public right-of-way and to finalize a new parcel map where Porter Ranch Community School was constructed.  
end
 
Recommendation 
Action Proposed:  
Authorize: (1) the dedication of a corner ramp easement to the City by adopting a Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School (Exhibit D) with a vote of at least two-thirds of its members; and (2) the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Final Parcel Map and all reasonable instruments associated with the easement.

Date of Public Hearing:                     December 16, 2025                     
 
Easement to be Dedicated:                      A 20-foot radius property line return at the intersection with Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue
end
 
Body 
Background:  
​​​In 2009, the District and Porter Ranch Development Company (“Seller”) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“Agreement”) for a parcel of land on which Porter Ranch Community School was constructed and is legally described in Exhibit A. As a condition of the Agreement and in compliance with the California Subdivision Map Act, the Seller was required to complete the recordation of a Final Parcel Map to formally map the property, with a $50,000 escrow holdback to be released to the Seller upon recordation of the map.
 
In 2014 the City’s Planning Department approved the Preliminary Parcel Map AA-2014-1367, and in 2022, the proposed Final Parcel Map was formally submitted to the City’s Land Development Division for review. The proposed map underwent multiple rounds of rigorous technical and regulatory review, involving coordination with the Seller, City’s Planning Department, City’s Bureau of Engineering, and the District. Following this extensive review process, the Final Parcel Map received official approval from the Land Development Division on May 19, 2025 (Exhibit B). As a condition of the City-approved Final Parcel Map, the District is required to dedicate a corner cut ramp easement at the intersection of Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue to the City to use for public access as a right-of-way.   
 
California Education Code sections 17556 through 17561 specify that a Notice of Adoption of Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Easements include a time not less than 10 days after adoption of the Resolution to hold a public hearing by the Board. The adopted Resolution must be posted in three public places within the District’s boundaries no less than 10 days before the date of the public hearing and be published no less five days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the District’s boundaries.  
​
Porter Ranch Community School is located within the boundaries of Region North, and Board District 3 (Scott Schmerelson).   
 
Expected Outcomes: 
Adopt the Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Final Parcel Map and all reasonable instruments associated with the easement.
 
Board Options and Consequences:  
If approved, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will proceed with the necessary steps to dedicate this corner ramp easement to the City and fulfill the District’s obligations under the Agreement and City-approved Final Parcel Map.  After the dedication, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will execute the Final Parcel Map and fulfill the District’s obligation under the Agreement.  After executing the Final Parcel Map, the proposed action will ensure the following: 
 
Legal Clarity: Transforms the parcel's legal description from a complex metes-and bounds narrative into a standardized, formal lot description, which will streamline real estate transactions and internal records. 
 
Survey Accuracy and Monumentation: Establishes a permanent, surveyed record of the property’s boundaries, which will ensure accuracy and public transparency. 
 
Formalization of Infrastructure: Solidifies the boundary of existing street improvements and the school footprint, including necessary dedications. 
 
Minimal Impact to District Property: The parcel adjustment results in a minor loss of approximately 55 square feet at the street corner, an area already encumbered by an ADA access ramp that is part of the Mason Ave. and Sesnon Blvd. public improvements. 
 
Recordation of the City-approved Final Parcel Map is not only a legal and procedural requirement, but also offers long-term benefits for the District in terms of clarity, compliance, and infrastructure integration.
 
If the Board does not approve the proposed action, the City cannot proceed with the required recordation of a Final Parcel Map, which will result in the legal boundaries of the school property not being finalized to match the as-built condition. The District will fail to meet its contractual obligation, which is likely to result in unnecessary litigation and related expenses.
 
Policy Implications:  
There is no change to District policy. 
 
Budget Impact:  
There is no budget impact.
 
Student Impact:  
​​​N/A​​ 
 
Equity Impact:  
N/A
 
Issues and Analysis:                       
The 2009 Purchase and Sale Agreement between the District and the Porter Ranch Development Company requires that a new parcel map be recorded as part of the purchase conditions.  Porter Ranch Development Company has recently received approval from the City to finalize this newly created parcel map.  
 
Failure to dedicate the corner ramp easement to the City will prohibit the required recordation of a Final Parcel Map, which will result in the legal boundaries of the school property not being finalized to match the as-built condition, and will likely expose the District to legal action.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  
 
A “No” vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
A “Yes” vote will approve all actions in accordance with Education Codes & Rules of the Personnel Commission 
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable
 
Budget Impact: 
Cost Neutral
 
Student Impact:

(Provisional Internship Permit) Recommends approval of 14 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 14 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education, deaf and hard of hearing, physical education, english, biological science, chemistry, social science and health science teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education, deaf and hard of hearing, physical education, english, biological science, chemistry, social science and health science teachers where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Consideration of Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District
Facilities Services Division
end
 
description
Brief Description:
(Consideration of Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District) Recommends authorization of the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to cast the Proposition 218 ballot(s) in support of the street lighting maintenance assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District (Lighting District) within the City of Los Angeles (City) and execute any other reasonable instruments on behalf of Los Angeles Unified in an amount not to exceed $14,710.41 annually (not including annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases). 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to cast the Proposition 218 ballot(s) in support of the street lighting maintenance assessment for the Lighting District within the City and execute any other reasonable instruments on behalf of Los Angeles Unified in an amount not to exceed $14,710.41 for the first year the Lighting District is in operation, and thereafter the annually adjusted amount inclusive of the Lighting District’s authorized CPI (or similar) increases for subsequent years until the Lighting District expires or is modified. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
The City Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Lighting is proposing a street lighting maintenance assessment for the Lighting District to add, maintain, and operate 75 new streetlights along Wilshire Boulevard, 7th Street, Burlington Avenue, Little Street, Union Avenue, Valencia Avenue, and Ingraham Street in Los Angeles. Of these, 59 streetlights would be installed along the perimeter of John H. Liechty Middle School and Esperanza Elementary School (Schools), as identified in Exhibit A. The Lighting District will need to submit ballots to property owners to vote on the assessment and to install the additional streetlights. The Lighting District provides servicing, installation, maintenance, and operation of street lighting. The cost for services includes but is not limited to electricity, lamps, fixtures, poles, wires, repair crews, and other items necessary to operate streetlights in the City. The additional lighting will further enhance safety measures and support safety passages. 
 
Los Angeles Unified currently pays $5,953.71 annually for 27 existing streetlights in this area. If approved and implemented, the annual amount for the special assessment projected by the Lighting District for the School would increase to $14,710.41 for the first year the lighting district is in operation, and thereafter the annually adjusted amount inclusive of the district’s authorized CPI (or similar) increases for subsequent years until the lighting district expires or is modified. This adjustment reflects several key factors: the existing assessment amounts have not been updated for inflation since 1997 due to Prop 218, which froze rates for over 25 years, and the methodology has changed from calculating rates based on property frontage to acreage, resulting in larger parcels incurring higher assessments. Additionally, the inclusion of street lighting, which requires more poles with closer spacing, adds a significant layer of maintenance costs, further contributing to the adjusted rates. 
 
The Lighting District is located in Region East, Board District 2 (Rocio Rivas).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the action will authorize Staff to execute the ballot in support of the proposed lighting assessment provided by the Lighting District and pay the annual assessment for the Lighting District. The increased lighting will help further enhance safe passages to and from school for students attending the School.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a yes vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. 
 
A “No” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a no vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. This may result in the Lighting District failing to obtain a majority affirmative vote of the property owners in the Lighting District. However, if the Lighting District does secure the required support, Los Angeles Unified would still be obligated to pay the cost associated with the special assessments.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 3 Engagement and Collaboration Leading for Impact by growing and leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations. Moreover, it supports the District’s Every School Safe: A Blueprint for Safety.
 
Budget Impact: 
The projected annual amount for the assessment of Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District in 2026 would be increased from $5,953.71 to $14,710.41  and subject to increases based on the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District budget annually thereafter. Annual assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District will be provided by the General Fund, Program Code 15190. This is a cost increase, but according to the projections from the Eco-Sustainability Office the program has adequate funding to support this assessment in the current fiscal year and the following fiscal year. The assessment is an ongoing annual cost and does not have a sunset date.
 
Student Impact:
Improve safety measures and support safe passages around the school perimeter and surrounding neighborhood.
 
Equity Impact:
A lighting district is a geographically defined area within the City, in which services, maintenance, and operations are paid for through a special assessment, which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide the agreed-upon services, activities, and operations.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Article 13 D (Proposition 218) of the State Constitution requires that a parcel’s assessment may not exceed the reasonable cost for the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel. Article 13 D provides that only special benefits are assessable, and the City must separate the general benefits from the special benefits. It also requires that publicly owned properties, which benefit from the improvements, be assessed.
The Bureau of Street Lighting is in the process of creating a Citywide Lighting District, which will require a new Engineer’s Report and an updated methodology for calculating street lighting maintenance assessment rates. Each parcel-including all LAUSD properties-will be evaluated to determine the proportionate special benefit conferred to each property. The proposed Citywide Lighting District and new Engineer’s Report will require approval by the Mayor’s Office and City Council, to establish the new District within the next two-three years. Currently, each parcel’s assessment is calculated in accordance with the Land Use Methodology outlined in the Street Lighting Engineer’s Report. Assessments are primarily based on the parcel’s land use, size (using a table of size ranges rather than a simple per-square-foot calculation), and the equipment type of the lighting system. Additional consideration is given for any benefit-qualifying factors, such as parcel shape and partial lighting. In accordance with City assessment standards, LAUSD will pay no more than other property owners for comparable parcels and benefits.
 
Los Angeles Unified is not obligated to support the formation of the Lighting District. Regardless of Los Angeles Unified’s support, if the Lighting District is approved, Los Angeles Unified will be required to pay its special assessment unless there has been a formal determination that it is exempt. 
 
The City has limited funding to provide certain services, and the Lighting District is able to supplement services that may benefit the community. Supporting the Lighting District is voluntary by the Board, however, Los Angeles Unified is obligated to pay the special assessment should the City Council vote to pass the Lighting District ballot presented.

Brief Description:
(Selection of Charter Operator to Lease the School Facility Located at 1215 Miramar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90026 and Authorization to Negotiate and Execute Agreements) Recommends to approve the selection of Los Angeles Academy for Arts and Enterprise (LAAAE) as the charter operator for the Central Los Angeles High School #12 (CLAHS#12) school facility, located at 1215 Miramar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90026 (Miramar Site), and enter into any reasonable agreements for the transaction to allow LAAAE to operate the Miramar Site.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the selection of LAAAE as the successful proposer, pursuant to the court-ordered Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for the Miramar Site, and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to negotiate and execute the Charter School Facilities Program (CSFP) Memorandum of Understanding (CSFP MOU), a Lease and Joint Use Agreement (Lease) and any other reasonable instruments to effectuate this transaction, including, but not limited to, a Development Agreement to allow for repairs to the Miramar Site.
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2005, the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) intended to develop the 1.37-acre District-owned property, now known as the Miramar Site, into a 19-classroom, 500-seat high school to relieve overcrowding at Belmont High School, formerly known as the CLAHS #12 Project (Project). In 2007 Los Angeles Unified unfunded 18 new construction projects as those projects were no longer needed for Districtwide two-semester operation, which included the CLAHS #12 Project. 
 
In 2009, Los Angeles Unified designated CLAHS #12 for charter school operations to address the increasing demand for secondary charter school facilities within the Belmont High School attendance area. Los Angeles Unified initiated a process to select a charter operator to fund the construction and operation of CLAHS #12.  
 
In 2010, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued to identify a charter operator for the Miramar Site. In 2012, Los Angeles Unified authorized the execution of a long-term lease and related instruments with Camino Nuevo Charter Academy (Camino Nuevo), the charter operator selected as part of the RFP process. As part of this transaction, Camino Nuevo was required to finance the construction of the CLAHS#12 Project at the Miramar Site. Camino Nuevo provided CSFP financing of $21.9 million, which included a $10 million State CSFP loan. The CSFP funding required Los Angeles Unified to enter into the CSFP MOU with Camino Nuevo and the State. The cost to construct the Miramar Site was approximately $30.8 million and Los Angeles Unified funded approximately $5.14M with charter bond program funds.
 
The Project was constructed in 2013, and Camino Nuevo began operating the Miramar Site under a 40-year lease as of July 1, 2013. After approximately seven and a half years, Camino Nuevo’s board voted to close the school effective June 30, 2021, due to declining enrollment and an inability to meet its financial obligations.
 
Pursuant to the CSFP MOU requirements, if a charter ceases operation in a CSFP-funded facility, Los Angeles Unified must:
1.                     Afford the charter up to six months if under revocation or non-renewal review;
2.                     Make reasonable efforts to identify a qualifying successor charter school; or
3.                     Operate the site as a District school and assume repayment of the CSFP loan, or declare the site surplus and dispose of it per State law.
 
Los Angeles Unified issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) on March 18, 2021, to solicit proposals for a successor charter school.  On June 8, 2021, the Board approved Alliance College Ready Public Schools (Alliance) as the successor operator, however, Alliance later withdrew.  Los Angeles Unified and the State subsequently issued an RFQ in December 2021.  However, the RFQ was subsequently cancelled in October 2022 before Ednovate Charter School could be authorized as the successor operator.
 
In 2022, the State filed suit against Los Angeles Unified.  As a result of the litigation, in late 2024 the court ordered that a new RFQ be issued and on July 1, 2025, Los Angeles Unified released the court-ordered RFQ for the Miramar Site.  The new RFQ was developed in conjunction with the State and contained substantially the same requirements as the previous RFQ, including: 
1.                     A minimum enrollment of 425 students, or demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 425 by July 1, 2026;
2.                     An agreement by the proposer to assume the outstanding CSFP loan balance (approximately $8.08 million) (CSFP Loan); 
3.                     Demonstration of financial soundness under CSFP Program Regulations Section 10154 (Financial Soundness); and 
4.                     Execution of a Lease with the District for the remaining 32-year CSFP lease term for the Miramar Site.  
 
The RFQ also provided an opportunity for a proposer to reimburse the District for $750,000 in costs previously incurred by Camino Nuevo for the operation and maintenance of the Miramar Site (M&O Costs).
 
LAAAE submitted the only proposal in response to the RFQ.  The State reviewed LAAAE’s financial records and projections and determined that LAAAE meets the threshold of Financial Soundness and can meet its financial obligations pursuant to its proposal, including, assuming the CSFP Loan, payment of the pro-rata share pursuant to the Lease, payment to the District of the M&O Costs, and the financial means to make necessary repairs to the facility prior to occupancy.  While LAAAE’s current enrollment is below the 425-student threshold established in the RFQ, the State believes LAAAE can reach enrollment of 429 by July 1, 2026, based on the documentation and explanation submitted by LAAAE. The State believes LAAAE demonstrates program growth and fiscal stability and the State sought and obtained approval of Financial Soundness on September 25, 2025, from its governing board.
 
LAAAE has agreed to sign the necessary agreements with the State and the District, and committed to satisfy all State and Los Angeles Unified requirements, including paying $750,000 for the M&O Costs within 60 days of signing the agreements.  LAAAE has no current pending or filed legal issues, claims, causes of action, lawsuits, or disputes against the State or Los Angeles Unified and the State and Los Angeles Unified do not have any against LAAAE.    
 
LAAAE is an independent charter school authorized by the Board on August 2004 for a maximum of 500 students in 6th through 12th grades.  LAAAE’s latest charter petition was renewed on March 2020 for a term of five (5) years.  Due to COVID, the term of its charter petition was legislatively extended for three (3) additional years, which extended LAAAE’s charter petition to June 30, 2027.  LAAAE has been in operation since 2005 and serves a large population of underprivileged students and 12% of its student population qualifies for Special Education.  LAAAE has operated on the Roybal Learning Center campus (Roybal) and is currently co-located at the Belmont High School campus.  LAAAE proposes to serve up to 500 students in 6th through 12th grade at the Miramar Site.  Although LAAAE will not be able to occupy the Miramar Site until the necessary repairs have been completed, which requires District plan review and approval, LAAAE has agreed to: 
1.                     Sign all necessary agreements upon 45 days following approval by the Board;
2.                     Pay the $750,000 outstanding M&O Costs within 60 days;
3.                     Begin making payments on the CSFP Loan per the terms negotiated with the State. 
 
LAAAE is expected to occupy the Miramar Site and relocate from Belmont High School as soon as feasible in the 2026-2027 school year.  Upon execution of the agreements and other reasonable instruments, the Miramar Site will be LAAAE’s responsibility to secure and maintain.  Upon occupancy, for the first three (3) years, Los Angeles Unified will maintain the Miramar Site at LAAAE’s sole cost and expense.  Thereafter, LAAAE may elect to assume the maintenance obligations by notifying Los Angeles Unified in writing of their election, and LAAAE must adhere to Los Angeles Unified’s maintenance standards and requirements.  Additionally, LAAAE will waive its Proposition 39 rights (as codified at Ed. Code Section 47614, and Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 11969.1‐11969.9 or otherwise) (Prop. 39) for the term of the Lease.
 
The Miramar School Site is located within the boundaries of MacArthur Park Community of Schools, Local District Central, and Board District 2 (Rocio Rivas).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approve the selection of LAAAE as the successor charter school to occupy the Miramar Site and authorize staff to negotiate and execute reasonable agreements for the occupancy and maintenance of the facility.
  
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “yes” vote by the Board will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive or her designee to negotiate and execute the Lease and any other reasonable  agreements for LAAAE’s operation of a 6th - 12th grade program and to  effectuate this transaction, including, but not limited to, the CSFP MOU and a Development Agreement to allow for LAAAE to make repairs to the Miramar Site.  LAAAE will be able to relocate its program from its co-located space at Belmont High School to the Miramar Site and Los Angeles Unified will be able to collect the M&O Costs.  Additionally, Los Angeles Unified will no longer be responsible for the security and maintenance of the Miramar Site which has cost Los Angeles Unified over $1,050,000 to date.
 
A “no” vote without a just excuse would violate the court’s order and likely subject the District, the Board and the Superintendent to civil penalties and possibly even harsher criminal penalties for continued non-compliance.  A “no” vote would also prevent LAAAE from operating, occupying, repairing and maintaining the Miramar Site, as well as from assuming the associated financial obligations owed to the State.  If the proposal is not approved Los Angeles Unified would continue to incur security and maintenance costs for the Miramar Site.  LAAAE would still be eligible to request classroom space under Prop. 39 and may continue to be co-located at Belmont High School.  Los Angeles Unified will also not be able to collect the $750,000 in M&O Costs and the State will not be able to collect the CSFP Loan.  Additionally, the District would be required to issue a new RFQ to comply with the court’s order.  
Policy Implications: 
This action does not alter existing Los Angeles Unified policy.  However, Camino Nuevo’s default on its CSFP-related obligations to the State and the District is the first known default under a CSFP agreement tied to a Los Angeles Unified property, necessitating the successor-operator process and associated State oversight.
 
Budget Impact: 
The activities associated with negotiating and executing agreements with LAAAE will require staff time from the Facilities Services Division and the Office of the General Counsel, however, no additional funding is needed to implement this action.
 
Upon Board approval and execution of agreements, the Los Angeles Unified will receive a $750,000 lump-sum reimbursement for the M&O Costs for the Miramar Site, to be deposited into the General Fund.  Los Angeles Unified will be able to cease securing and maintaining the Miramar School Site which will result in savings of over $20,000 per month.
 
Student Impact:
By relocating to the Miramar Site, LAAAE would provide its students  with access to on-site facilities including a library, multi-purpose room, and a fully equipped food services kitchen, as well as adjacent physical education spaces at Miguel Contreras Learning Complex (MCLC). Upon occupancy of the Miramar Site, LAAAE intends to relocate from its current locations and operate the program at the Miramar Site.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The Miramar Site was heavily vandalized and damaged during the time that it has been vacant.  LAAAE will not be able to occupy the Miramar Site until the facility is repaired and is safe to occupy.  LAAAE will be responsible for paying for the costs to repair the facility to meet, among others, Los Angeles Unified’s standards and specifications.
 
In order to qualify as the successor charter school, and assume payment of the outstanding CSFP Loan, LAAAE must meet the State’s criteria for Financial Soundness.  The court-ordered RFQ requires that LAAAE meet a minimum enrollment of 425 students or demonstrated ability to grow to an enrollment of 425 by July 1, 2026.  LAAAE has provided information detailing how it intends to grow to 425 students.  The State determined that LAAAE has met the threshold of Financial Soundness and is able to assume the CSFP Loan which was approved at the September 25, 2025 meeting of the Charter School Finance Authority.  In addition to being able to pay for the CSFP Loan, the State determined LAAAE is also able to meet its financial obligations under the Lease, pay the M&O Costs in the amount of $750,000 and pay for the repairs to the Miramar Site.  The shared goal of the State and Los Angeles Unified is to select a qualifying successor charter school and implement assumption of the CSFP Loan upon Board approval and execution of the Lease and other necessary agreements.
 
If the Board approves the selection of LAAAE and authorizes the Chief Facilities Executive, and/or designee(s), to execute the Lease and any other reasonable instruments, staff will proceed to negotiate and execute the required documents with LAAAE, including terms reflecting assumption of the CSFP Loan and payment of the $750,000 M&O Costs to the Los Angeles Unified.
 
Subject to final Lease terms, Los Angeles Unified will provide site maintenance and operations at LAAAE’s cost pursuant to Los Angeles Unified standards, with the option for LAAAE, after an initial transition period, to self-perform M&O in accordance with Los Angeles Unified standards and at its sole expense.  LAAAE will also reimburse the Los Angeles Unified for its proportionate share of costs associated with use of MCLC physical education facilities.

Brief Description:
(Certification of Unhoused Pupils for Charter School Facilities Program Application) Recommends adoption of a resolution to fulfill the requirements of the California Code of Regulations Title 2 Section 1859.162.1, in support of Port of Los Angeles High School’s (POLAHS) independent application for funding under the Charter Schools Facilities Program (CSFP).
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt attached resolution (Exhibit A) certifying that zero state-recognized unhoused pupils in grades K-12 and in the Special Day Class (SDC) Non-Severe and Severe programs will be served by the charter school new-construction project for which POLAHS will independently submit a CSFP funding application by October 30, 2025 (Resolution).
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2002, Assembly Bill (AB) 14 created the CSFP. Through the passage of Propositions 47 (2002), 55 (2004), 1D (2006), 51 (2016), and 2 (2024), $2 billion in state bond authority has been made available for the construction of new charter school facilities or the rehabilitation of school district facilities that are at least 15 years old for charter school use. The Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) is administering a single filing round, which opened on July 3, 2025, to allocate the entire $600 million CSFP bond authority from Proposition 2. Applications for this filing round must be submitted to the OPSC and the Charter School Finance Authority (CSFA) by October 30, 2025.
 
Upon receipt of a charter school’s notice of intent to apply for CSFP funds, LAUSD, using the method adopted by the Board of Education in May 2007 (Exhibit B), must determine its number of “unhoused pupils,” defined as the number of pupils by which the District’s projected enrollment exceeds its existing classroom capacity. If there are unhoused pupils, the District must use the method to determine how many of those unhoused pupils will be served by the proposed charter school project.  Pursuant to 2 CCR Section 1859.162.1, this result must be certified by the District’s governing board in a resolution presented at a regularly scheduled, publicly held board meeting and submitted to the Office of Public School Construction within 90 days of the District’s receipt of notification that the charter school intends to apply for CSFP funding.  The deadline for charter schools to notify the District of plans to submit CSFP applications during the current funding cycle was September 30, 2025.
 
At the time of the LAUSD Board’s August 26, 2025 meeting, LAUSD staff had received two letters of intent to apply for CSFP funding, all of which were for proposed projects serving K-12 and/or SDC non-severe pupils and located on non-LAUSD sites.  At that meeting, the Board certified that zero unhoused K-12 or SDC non-severe pupils will be served by charter schools submitting CSFP applications during the current funding cycle (Exhibit C).  Subsequently, however, POLAHS, which, in addition to grade 9-12 and SDC non-severe pupils, serves SDC severe pupils, notified the District of its plans to submit a CSFP application.  Application of the District’s May 2007 method shows that zero unhoused SDC severe pupils will be served by POLAHS’s project, and an additional resolution is now required to certify this fact.  The deadline for submitting this resolution to OPSC is December 3, 2025.
 
Note that, under CSFP regulations, all charter schools intending to submit CSFP applications during the current funding cycle will remain eligible for funding even if the school district certifies that zero unhoused pupils will be served.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt the Resolution, thus fulfilling the requirements of California Code of Regulations Title 2, Section 1859.162.1. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Board approval of the proposed action will ensure compliance with 2 CCR section 1859.162.1 requirements and will allow POLAHS to proceed with its CSFP application. This will not affect LAUSD’s new-construction eligibility since no unhoused pupils will be served by the POLAHS project. However, if the proposed action is deferred or not approved, LAUSD will be in noncompliance with 2 CCR 1859.162.1, and POLAHS will be unable to proceed with its CSFP funding application, which could result in a legal dispute between LAUSD and the school.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action will not change current LAUSD policy. A Board resolution certifying the number of unhoused pupils is essential in meeting CSFP requirements for charter schools applying on their own behalf.
 
Budget Impact: 
District funding is not required for the adoption of the Resolution.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed action will enable POLAHS to file a CSFP application for state funding, thus helping it provide safe and effective learning environments for its students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Once a charter school applicant submits its CSFP application, it will proceed through the state’s regulatory process for scoring, prioritization, and potential award.  If selected for funding, the project will continue through the state’s funding process, with all required reporting administered by the state and performed by the charter school’s staff.  This portion of the process does not involve or impact District staff, students, or budget.

Brief Description:
description
(Integrated Pest Management Policy Revision) Recommends approval of the update to the existing LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team Policy to allow for a simple majority  quorum and the selection of Team member alternates. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
The Board of Education (“Board”) is asked to update the existing LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”) Policy to allow for a simple majority quorum and the selection of Team member alternates. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”). The Team serves to provide guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property, and the environment.  
 
Since returning from fully remote participation during the COVID-19 global pandemic, the TEAM has experienced challenges meeting quorum.  The main basis for this challenge is the original Policy requiring a quorum of 10 members, as opposed to a simple majority quorum. The Team is comprised of 15 Team members, which makes a simple quorum 8 (as opposed to the currently required 10).   
 
Over the course of several meetings, the IPM Team has made clear and requested that the Board amend the Policy to reflect a simple majority quorum.   
 
The IPM Team further would like to instate a process for the approval and maintenance of IPM Team member alternates so that the business of the Team can continue uninterrupted even in the absence of existing regular members. IPM Team alternates will attend all IPM meetings so as to be informed of the material the Team is addressing.  Additionally, alternates shall be selected, proposed, and approved in the same manner as existing members: (a) Proposed alternates must fit within the constituencies as defined by existing Policy, (b) must be proposed by the IPM Team itself, (c) must prepare and submit ethics forms and brief bio, and (d) must be approved by the Board. IPM Team alternates shall have the power to vote and shall count towards quorum when acting as alternates for absent regular members.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The IPM Team will be able to meet quorum more easily, thereby dramatically increasing the likelihood of meetings where discussion and action can legally take place within the framework of the Brown Act.  
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges. Quorum will continue to be a real challenge to meet, and the Team will be unable to carry out the duties they are charged with under the IPM Policy.  
 
Policy Implications: 
Positive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.

(Integrated Pest Management Vacancy Approvals) Recommends approval of the appointment of 3 individuals to the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”) in order to fill vacant positions. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
The Board of Education (“Board”) is asked to approve the appointment of 3 individuals to the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”) in order to fill vacant positions. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”). The Team serves to provides guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property, and the environment.  
 
From time to time, vacancies occur, and these vacancies must be filled by approval of proposed individuals by the Board.  The prospective members are proposed by the IPM team itself, or comes from one of the constituencies as defined by the original Policy. 
 
The current vacancies needing to be filled are (1) a public health representative, (2) a District non-management representative from Maintenance and Operations, and (3) a representative from LAUSD Office of Environmental Health and Safety. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the three proposed members to fill existing vacancies in order to provide for a full Team as directed by the IPM Policy.  The Team and all members will operate consistent with the terms of the Policy.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges. Quorum will be a challenge to meet, and constituencies required by the Policy will remain unrepresented. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Positive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.

description
Whereas, The increasing frequency and severity of extreme heat events, wildfires, and other climate driven disasters demand immediate action, and local agencies like the Los Angeles Unified School District cannot afford to wait for state or federal intervention alone, but must act with urgency to safeguard the health, safety, and learning conditions of students and staff; 
 
Whereas, The impacts of the climate crisis fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color, whose neighborhoods often lack access to cooling systems, tree canopy, shade, and resilient infrastructure, making it imperative that the District lead with equity by prioritizing policies and investments that protect those most vulnerable; 
 
Whereas, These unequal impacts are not accidental, but the result of decades of intentional disinvestment, redlining, and environmental racism that have left Black, brown, immigrant, and low-income students learning in campuses with fewer resources and greater exposure to climate hazards;
Whereas, The District has invested in making our campuses greener and more resilient, but many campuses still have outdated cooling infrastructure and lack shade and climate resilient designs, which can lead to disrupted instruction and negative impacts on student learning both in classrooms and in outdoor education; 
 
Whereas, Green spaces are a critical component of mitigating extreme heat and improving air quality, and the District, as outlined in the Green Schools for All Resolution (Res 002-22/23), has established a 30% green space and 20% tree canopy standard for its playgrounds and has committed $1.2B from Measure US towards meeting those ambitious goals; 
 
Whereas, While recognizing the need for some blacktop and open hard surfaces to meet physical education, green spaces have proven benefits when leveraged for physical activity, play spaces, and outdoor learning classrooms;
 
 Whereas, Beyond the significant detriments to health and wellbeing, there are serious concerns around the impacts of heat exposure to children’s learning. A recent systemic review published in July 2025 in PLOS Climate found that extended exposure to heat impairs students’ cognitive abilities, negatively affecting their academic performance; 
 
Whereas, Artificial turf adds to the impacts of extreme heat, since it absorbs and retains far more solar radiation than natural grass creating surface temperatures reaching in excess of 160 degrees, exacerbating the urban heat island effect, with growing body of research and health and environmental experts expressing concerns over the potential for harm including burns, chemical exposure, and other injuries (L.A. Times, September, 2025); 
 
Whereas, Extreme heat does not impact all schools equally, with the harshest impacts borne by campuses in dense, heat-burdened neighborhoods that already lack trees, parks, and cooling infrastructure, leaving students in these communities more exposed to dangerous conditions and less able to learn in safe environments;
 
Whereas, The growing impacts of extreme heat demand a comprehensive approach to protect the health and safety of students and staff, requiring the District to evaluate and address multiple vulnerabilities at once including the environmental and health risks posed by artificial turf, the strain of aging HVAC systems during heat waves, and the uneven access to critical protections such as shade structures and hydration stations, so that all campuses are adequately prepared to mitigate the dangers of rising temperatures;
 
Whereas, The District has created tools for response to extreme weather events, including the issuing of heat advisories with recommendations and the Enhanced Emergency Preparedness Bulletin to support school leaders in making timely and informed decisions during heat-related natural disasters, including through the use of the Natural Disaster Decision-Making Matrix, Tiered Fire Support system, and new tools such as the Wildfire Decision-Making Tree;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that school buildings must have actionable plans in place for temporarily posturing their buildings and HVAC systems to reduce the negative impact of extreme heat, wildfire smoke, and other potential airborne contaminants, as well as an actionable plan in place to return to normal operation and verify proper operation of all HVAC systems;
 
Whereas, Shade, through trees, canopies, and other natural or built features, is one of the most effective and immediate protections and the District’s facilities division has committed to a goal of at least 20% shade coverage when undertaking campus greening projects, it is critical to assess current progress toward the benchmark and adopt a clear actionable strategy to meet it; yet schools in historically redlined and under-resourced neighborhoods continue to have the least shade coverage, leaving their students disproportionately exposed to unsafe outdoor conditions; and 
 
Whereas, Funds from voter-approved bond measures including LAUSD’s local facilities bond Measure US, and state bond measures Proposition 2 and Proposition 4 create an opportunity to further prioritize District capital investments to increase the build out of renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems on District property to sustainably power upgraded HVAC systems, ensuring long-term cost savings and climate resilience for campuses, and urgent action is needed to secure federal clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits before they expire; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District shall update its disaster preparedness plans to ensure a comprehensive response to escalating threats posed by extreme heat and related climate emergencies including wildfires so that they clearly outline (1) decision-makers and clear metrics for operational procedures such as shifting school schedules and closures, (2) guidance on continuity of instruction, (3) notification of school site leaders, staff, and families on District response and any other necessary information that can be shared in coordination with City and County emergency response agencies, and (4) include necessary training for staff on the updated protocols. This process shall solicit feedback from all relevant District divisions, labor partners, school site staff, families, students, and community stakeholders, to ensure the plan reflects on the ground needs, and report back to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District in 90 days; 
 
Resolved further, That considering the need to ensure our campus infrastructure can address extreme heat events, the District shall:
 
•                     Accelerate HVAC system replacements in alignment with the existing MERV 13 standards, with the goal of having at least 20-25 projects (standalone HVAC system upgrades and/or as a component of a larger project, excluding comprehensive modernization projects) underway at all times, with annual progress reports to the Board included in the annual update of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan. Standalone projects at campuses shall continue to be prioritized based on system condition, and where schools cannot be maintained at below the Cal/OSHA indoor temperature standard of 82 degrees Fahrenheit, with subsequent consideration given to student need (such as SENI ranking) and community climate burden (such as CalEnviro Screen and extreme heat exposure);
•                     Implement, to the extent feasible, the use of climate-friendly, all electric technologies such as heat pumps, in HVAC modernization projects, aligned with the District’s goals to transition to 100% clean, renewable energy, and where feasible, to incorporate opportunities for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to sustainably power upgraded HVAC systems;
•                     Provide an update by the end of the 2025-2026 school year on progress on the District’s strategy from the Business Services and Operations Division for the deployment of additional heat mitigation measures such as expanded tree canopy, shade structures, nature-based cooling solutions such as native plantings and permeable surfaces, hydration stations, and misting systems to ensure students and staff have access to cooling space and protection from heat, including how the deployment strategy prioritizes communities most impacted by extreme heat and air pollution;
•                     Prepare and present an Interim Heat Mitigation Plan to protect students and staff at schools with aging HVAC systems, with limited shade coverage under 20%, and where indoor temperatures cannot be maintained below the 82 degree indoor temperature threshold set by Cal/OSHA. The plan will outline short-term strategies to reduce heat exposure, including the use of portable cooling units, hydration stations, and designated cool zones; adjusted schedules and outdoor activity modifications during peak heat. The plans will ensure frontline schools in historically disinvested communities (based on SENI ranking, extreme heat exposure or CalEnviroScreen exposure as described above) receive protections so they are not forced to bear disproportionate risks while awaiting full modernization. Clear communication protocols will ensure timely guidance to school leaders and families, bridging the gap until full modernization efforts are complete;
•                     Ensure adequate staffing for the ongoing repair and maintenance of HVAC systems, shade structures, hydration stations, and other critical heat-mitigation infrastructure, with staffing levels reviewed annually to align with Districtwide needs and equity priorities;
•                     Develop a plan to verify the proper operation of all existing HVAC systems through Ventilation Verification, using appropriately qualified and certified personnel consistent with applicable code, manufacturer requirements, recognized engineering and public health standards, and state standards established under AB 841 (CalSHAPE) and applicable ASHRAE and Title 24 requirement, taking into consideration the recommendations of UC Davis and the National Energy Management Institute recommendations; and
•                     Explore opportunities to apply for Proposition 2 and 4 funding to help address the heat mitigation goals, campus greening, energy efficiency and the clean energy goals and prioritize District applications to these and other funding sources to build on the District’s Measure US investments to enhance air quality, add green space, and protect the health of students, staff, and families;
 
Resolved further, That in recognition of the significant environmental and climate consequences of artificial turf, including the release of microplastics, into soil and waterways, and its absorption and radiation of heat that exacerbates the urban heat island effect, the District shall update its policy to:
 
•                     Prohibit installation of artificial turf at early education centers, primary centers, elementary schools, and middle schools, regardless of funding source;
•                     Prioritize the replacement of existing artificial turf at early education centers (EECs) and Elementary schools, in particular, as they reach their end-of-life with grass, plants, or natural materials to the extent feasible; including potential pilots for natural groundcover as an alternative to grass that still provide safe play areas but require less water and lower maintenance, with pilots prioritized for schools in communities that have been historically under-resourced and disproportionately burdened by extreme heat, pollution, and lack of access to safe green space;
•                     Temporarily pause projects not yet approved by the Board to replace synthetic turf until after a comprehensive study and policy update (described below) has been completed and the Board has given direction about the future of these fields (to remain synthetic turf or convert to natural grass) and develop contingency plans to ensure impacted students have access to necessary play and athletic spaces during this period;
•                     Identify funding to:
 
o                     Conduct a lifecycle cost and operations comparison of synthetic and natural turf athletic fields, covering installation, maintenance, water use, expected service life; field availability (e.g., hours of play between maintenance/closures); and end-of-life removal/disposal;
o                     Perform a comprehensive synthesis of current literature, research and government studies on synthetic and natural turf, including runoff/microplastics, injury/health outcomes, environmental/climate impact, incorporating available District data;
o                     Assess heat-exposure conditions on synthetic turf fields (e.g., surface temperature profiles and thresholds) and, based on the findings, provide operational guidance to schools for mitigation heat exposure, such as scheduling early morning/evening activity, heat advisories, cooling interventions;
o                     Gather input from labor partners, school staff, students, families, and community members;
•                     Findings shall be publicly presented and reviewed at appropriate venues, including meetings of the Governing Board of Education, the Committee of the Whole, and the Greening Schools & Climate Resilience Committee, to ensure transparency. All resulting policy updates must explicitly address equity impacts and demonstrate how the District will correct historic patterns of underinvestment in schools serving Black, brown, immigrant, indigenous and low-income communities; and
 
Resolved further, That the District shall establish a clear, districtwide Heat-Stroke Emergency Prevention and Response Protocol for all school sites to ensure prompt and consistent action when a student or staff member shows signs of heat stroke. The protocol shall apply to all school environments both indoors and outdoors, and include: immediate activation of emergency medical services; clear expectations for monitoring as outlined by LAUSD Guidelines for Preventing Heat Stress Bulletin 963.3, dated July 14, 2025; guidance on beginning rapid on-site cooling using available equipment, including portable solutions that can be deployed immediately without relying on electricity, ice, or refrigerated storage; written procedures assessable to all staff; and annual training for staff who supervise outdoor activities so they can recognize symptoms and respond quickly; and
 
Resolved further, That the District shall complete this study, transmit the findings to the Board, and use them to update the Policy Bulletin, which shall be brought back to the Board in Spring 2026; and, be it, finally
 
Resolved, That regular updates on extreme heat mitigation and the District’s response shall be included in the annual report of the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to the Committee of the Whole, the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee, and the LAUSD-UTLA Joint Climate Task Force.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to improving and maintaining state-of-the-art facilities-including 1,200 schools and 21,000 buildings-that maximize student learning, provide enrichment opportunities, and serve the public and community;
 
Whereas, The District strives to manage public funds and District-owned properties with transparency, efficiency, and accountability;
 
Whereas, Any use of school facilities or access to District owned property must be documented and authorized by an agreement such as a civic center permit, filming permit, or license agreement. The Real Estate and Business Development department within the District’s Facilities Service Division is responsible for processing and preparing these agreements. These agreements allow users to access the District’s public facilities, and generate approximately $15 million in annual revenue for the District;
 
Whereas, The Civic Center Act detailed in California Education Code §§ 38130-38139 requires school districts to make their facilities available for community use when not needed for school purposes. Local organizations and members of the public may utilize District facilities for recreation and sports, public meetings and forums, arts, music, and cultural events, childcare, and more; 
 
Whereas, Each school district adopts its own board policy and administrative regulations implementing the Civic Center Act including application processes, priority use schedules, fee structure, insurance and liability coverage, and permitted activities;   
 
Whereas, The District adopted BUL-6894.1 entitled, ""Procedures for Third-Party Use of School Facilities” in February 2018 and has not since updated the policies and procedures;
 
Whereas, Partners and members of the community currently utilize District owned property-including schools, athletic fields, and gyms-for a variety of purposes including community meetings, athletic and enrichment activities, camps, carnivals, filming and more;
 
Whereas, Given the broad scope of duty to manage 21,000 buildings and its charge to address Proposition 39 charter school facilities agreements, the District’s Real Estate and Leasing Department is overextended beyond its capacity to thoroughly assess District assets and it is vital to provide appropriate customer service to members of the community who may be interested in utilizing district facilities; 
 
Whereas, The District should consider realigning the Real Estate and Leasing Department around four key functional areas: including 1) licensing/access, 2) asset management, 3) revenue generation, and 4) compliance;
 
Whereas, The District’s current system to receive and process agreements is inefficient and is not designed to handle the complexity, volume, or opportunity presented by the number and types of District facilities available for third-party use;
 
Whereas, Currently, District facilities are underutilized for community use beyond the school day, which represents untapped opportunity for community benefit and revenue generation for the District;
 
Whereas, Unlike in other systems, members of the public cannot currently access a centralized portal to view or request facility use, and internal systems lack automation, performance monitoring, and transparency; and
 
Whereas, A centralized digital platform with online applications, automated alerts, and public-facing access is necessary to streamline operations, improve customer experience, and reduce compliance risk; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That in order to improve the community and partner use of Los Angeles Unified School District (District) facilities and to maximize revenue to the District, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School (Board) directs the District to:
 
•                     Determine funding and issue Request for Proposal(s) (RFP) for an updated, centralized, online real estate and facilities management platform to support intake, workflow tracking, agreement management, and performance monitoring. The system should be user-friendly and include:
o                     Automated deadline alerts and internal notifications for District staff
o                     Public-facing tools for site browsing, pricing, online applications, and online payments (i.e., ACH, credit card);
o                     External notifications sent to external partners at a minimum of three weeks before the facilities will be used for the event;
•                     Coordinate with and support school administrators to align site availability, community access, and scheduling, and develop a plan to centralize a facility use calendar and communication plan to support higher utilization and equitable access;
•                     Evaluate options and develop a plan to update and simplify the public facing website to make facility options and pricing structures more transparent and responsive to community needs;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall review and revise its policy and procedures regarding facilities access, use, and fees, including to reflect recent legislation, demand and availability, and equity considerations. The updated policy should include:
•                     Criteria to prioritize access, where feasible, for organizations that serve underserved youth-including those with disabilities, and LGBTQ or gender nonconforming youth-as well as those that provide free or low-cost programs focused on sports, play, and enrichment;
•                     A tiered cost structure for the use of District facilities that takes into account the applicant’s status (e.g., nonprofit vs. for-profit, and/or municipalities and other government entities), event participants and/or users including District students and families, and the type of programming or services provided (e.g., tenant rights clinics, immigration rights clinics, counseling services, unhoused student/family supports, early education centers and childcare programs for children birth to age five, and housing assistance), and whether that programming or services are free or fee-based;
 
Resolved further, That District facilities work closely with Risk Management to streamline processes on the appropriate documentation needed in conjunction with the services offered by specific organizations, such as medical organizations, athletic organizations, etc.;
 
Resolved further, That the District will support Parent/Teacher Associations, Parent/Teacher Organizations, non-profit Booster organizations, etc., through a simple renewal process for facility use, allowing recurring rentals based on rental history; and
 
Resolved, That the District report back to the Board within 120 days with the revised policy and plan to achieve the actions outlined above, including timelines, cost estimates, revenue estimates, potential uses of revenues, and staffing needs to support implementation of the plan by the beginning of the 2026-2027 school year.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Brief Description:
description
(Request for Approval of 2026 Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities) Recommends authorizing the Office of Governmental Relations (OGR), on behalf of Los Angeles Unified, to sponsor legislation and proactively advocate for policy and funding proposals at the local, state, and federal levels. All advocacy efforts will align with and support the goals, strategies, and initiatives outlined in the District's 2022-26 Strategic plan.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the 2026 Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Each year OGR presents to the Board proposed advocacy priorities for the upcoming year. This includes securing authors for legislation, advocating for changes/inclusion in budget and funding proposals, and taking positions on related bills, regulatory changes, and policy issues as presented on the attached documents. Given the unprecedented challenges the District has faced in recent years and the uncertainty that lies ahead, it will be important to build in flexibility to authorize the Office of Governmental Relations to pursue the necessary advocacy on other policy and funding priorities as new issues arise in 2026.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approved policy and funding priorities will result in a coherent advocacy agenda that the Office of Governmental Relations will promote and advance by building local and state coalitions with a diverse set of education partners.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval will allow OGR staff to proceed in a timely manner to secure authors for legislation and pursue advocacy with the various levels of government. 
 
Delay in approval will negatively impact the securing of authors for legislation prior to the legislative deadlines for the introduction of bills.
 
Policy Implications: 
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support existing Board policies and are in alignment with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Budget Impact: 
None.
 
Student Impact:
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support students and their academic achievement either directly or indirectly through legislation and policies.  
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable

(Provisional Internship Permit) Recommends approval of 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
These are contracted full time teachers working under a provisional internship permit. The positions are either norm funded, funded by division of special education or purchased by the school site.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education teachers where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints. 
 
A “No” vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
A ”Yes” vote will approve all actions in accordance with Education Codes & Rules of the Personnel Commission.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable
 
Budget Impact: 
Cost Neutral
 
Student Impact:

(Approval of Non-Formula Grant Agreements: Ratification of Delegated Authority) Recommends the ratification of those actions related to the application for, and receipt of non-formula grants, including the execution of related agreements and documents, taken by the Office of Grants Administration and Office of the Superintendent within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A.” 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the grant actions related to the application for, and receipt of non-formula grants, including the execution of related agreements and documents, taken by the Office of Grants Administration and Office of the Superintendent within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A.”  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Prior to the establishment of the Office of Grants Administration, the District’s approach to grant management was decentralized with multiple departments and schools independently identifying and pursuing supplemental funding for their respective areas when they have available resources to do so.  
 
Pursuant to Delegation No. 42, initially issued by the Board of Education on December 13, 2016, and as most recently amended on December 12, 2017, the Superintendent and/or their designee was authorized to sign on behalf of the Board of Education grant applications, amendments, and related correspondence, such as letters of support, prior to submission. As stated in that delegation, “an action item would be presented to the Board for approval upon receipt of a grant award.” Various other previously issued delegations granted authority to certain Divisions and Offices to accept grant funds and/or to execute grant agreements on behalf of the Board of Education. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the resources and services provided by these non-formula grants to be awarded to the Los Angeles Unified School District and schools that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of non-formula grants awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” may result in immediate unavailability of resources or discontinuance of services, or both. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code sections 35161 and 17604, which permit the Board of Education to delegate authority to contract, including by way of grants, in the name of the District, and which the Board exercised on December 12, 2017.
 
Budget Impact: 
The receipt of these non-formula grant funds will result in additional one-time resources for individual schools as grant recipients or in support of districtwide initiatives that could benefit students, staff and the school community. Any grant actions presented that require a matching grant are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.
 
Student Impact:
The grant funds could benefit students directly or indirectly depending on the purpose of the grant.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these non-formula grants. The Office of General Counsel and Procurement Services Division have reviewed and approved agreements where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Brief Description:
(Community Challenge Grant 2.0 - Renewal to Launch A New Three-Year Cycle). Recommends approval of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 program and authorization to award a total of $2,100,000 in individual Community Challenge grants over a three-year period, to tax-exempt community organizations to provide high quality enrichment activities outside of the school and school day to Los Angeles Unified District students enrolled in high need schools.
end
 
description
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal of the Community Challenge Grant program (Community Challenge Grant 2.0) for a new three-year term, from January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2029, and authorize the award of individual Community Challenge grants in the range of $25,000-$50,000 to tax-exempt community organizations, up to a total amount of $2,100,000.
 
Body
Background: 
On November 14, 2023, in Board Report 087-23/24, the Board authorized the Procurement Services Division to negotiate and award a total of $2 million in individual Community Challenge grants to tax-exempt community organizations over a three-year period, to provide high-quality after-school enrichment activities and services to District students.  The Division of Communications, Engagement & Collaboration was tasked with the management of outreach activities and convening central office teams to assess Community Challenge grant applications. 
 
A total of 23 grantees provided services for LAUSD students during SY 2024-25, impacting over 700 students and over 80 parents. We anticipate serving over 1,300 students and over 200 parents total within the initial round (Community Challenge Grant 1.0).  
 
In year one of the first round (1.0), grantees implemented innovative programming designed to help students boost literacy, feel a stronger sense of belonging, apply to college, and develop new skills. Families benefited from workshops that prepared them to support their child’s pathway to college. Partners have responded swiftly to urgent needs amid recent immigration actions, and many have also participated in District-led initiatives such as We Are One and Principal for a Day.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Adoption of the renewal of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will allow Los Angeles Unified to expand enrichment support services to students and families at grantee facilities through a second grant cycle that will allow additional grantees to apply. Prior grantees will be invited to reapply. Selected grant recipients will be presented for Board ratification, as they were in the prior round.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this renewal of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will: authorize the District to solicit applications for a new grant cycle; and award a total of $2.1 million in individual Community Challenge grants to tax exempt community organizations within a three-year period to provide additional enrichment opportunities for students and parents outside of the instructional day and in trusted community spaces.
 
If this program is not renewed, Los Angeles Unified will eliminate one opportunity to engage community organizations that have not historically worked directly with the District to provide services.
 
Policy Implications: 
Los Angeles Unified will engage with tax-exempt organizations via grant agreements that will allow enrichment services aligned with the District’s Strategic Plan to be provided off school campuses. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget of $2.1 million in Unrestricted General Funds will allow approximately 21-24 tax-exempt organizations to be awarded $25,000 to $50,000 in grant funds to provide enrichment services to students and parents after school and at their sites. The entire $2.1 million in approved funds are passed through the District to the grantees. Costs associated with staffing, management, overhead and oversight of the grant program are all absorbed by the Office of Development & Civic Engagement. These activities currently utilize approximately 15% of available staffing resources within this Office.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed renewal of the program will support data-informed student and parent needs in academics, wellness, college-readiness, and parent engagement. The program will serve approximately 600-1000 students each school year, which represents grant funding utilization of approximately $1,050- $1,750 per student per annum.
 
Equity Impact:
The Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will give preference to tax-exempt organizations that serve Priority School and High and Highest Need SENI 2.0 school communities. In addition, organizations that have a demonstrated track record of trust and engagement with those communities will also be given preference.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the program is time sensitive in order to allow for the solicitation of applications, ratification of grant agreements, and execution of grant agreements to be established before May 2026, so that services can be provided as early as Summer 2026.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Department within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Department within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with the Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts to furnish the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Good and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See Attachment A for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Teams, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Three Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of three critical school facility projects to replace and upgrade essential building and site systems, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $9,762,321, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve three projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $9,762,321.  
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and procurement of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Playa Del Rey Elementary School and Chester W. Nimitz Middle School along with a project to renovate the swimming pool at Panorama High School.
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $9,762,321 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. 
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 2,650 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact: 
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Two Early Education Center Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of two projects to provide outdoor classrooms and campus upgrades at early education centers, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $20,115,559, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve two Early Education Center (EEC) Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Projects (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $20,115,559.
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects, including budget modifications and procurement of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Projects will provide outdoor classrooms at Shenandoah Street Early Education Center and 112th St. Early Education Center by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. The intent of the proposed Projects is to create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classrooms may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging
•                     Building materials
 
In addition, the proposed Projects will receive campus upgrades which include new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, roofing, new shade structures, fire alarm system and utilities upgrades, accessibility upgrades, and additional scope as detailed in Exhibit A.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board of Education will define and approve the proposed Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Projects. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, access to nature-based green space will remain limited, and early education facilities needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the proposed Projects is $20,115,559. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each budget for the proposed Projects was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about their proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual budgets for the proposed Projects will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known and/or unforeseen conditions arise, and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each of the proposed Projects.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning to benefit approximately 140 current and future students.
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor classrooms will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
 
Equity Impact:
The proposed Projects were identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with Regions and school site administrators. Sites were selected based upon each center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Projects’ proposals in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Projects’ scopes will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Projects’ scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve the 24th Street Elementary School Barrier Removal Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a barrier removal project at 24th Street Elementary School (Board District 1, Region South) and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein with a budget of $432,291; and authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the 24th Street Elementary School (School) Barrier Removal Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The budget for the proposed Project is $432,291.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board of Education (Board) approved the Transition Plan under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements (Transition Plan). The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
A need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access buildings at the School has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student’s need for programmatic access. These types of projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed “rapidly” with a budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed Project does not meet the parameters of the RAP due to its scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the proposed Project to the Board for approval.
 
The School site spans 6.77 acres and is comprised of a traditional transitional kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school and a co-located charter school program. The building area is approximately 98,900 square feet and includes five multi-story permanent buildings, five single-story permanent buildings, and six relocatable buildings. The permanent buildings were constructed between 1926 and 2011. As of the 2025-2026 Electronic Capacity Assessment Report (E-CAR), the school serves approximately 477 students and currently 117 students have been identified as having a disability.
 
The site has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level. To meet the criteria for Category Two, upgrades to one building are required including the reconfiguration of the kiln room into an accessible restroom in the administration building, and any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2027.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve the Project and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately implement the proposed Project.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the barrier removal project which is required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves.  This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the proposed Project is $432,291 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
The budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 440 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at this campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities staff work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability.  As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities.  This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible.  While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities.  A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities.  This proposed Project is in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.
 
The School has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing a more robust scope that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that reconfiguring the kiln room in the administration building to provide an accessible restroom would provide students and staff direct access to the building. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Expected Outcomes:  
Staff anticipate that the Board will amend the ITS SEP to define the new project described herein and allocate $166,288,260 of Bond Program funding. This project will enable the District to modernize network and telecommunications infrastructure at 198 K-12 school sites, ensuring reliable, high-speed connectivity and improved communication systems. 
 
This project directly contributes to achievement of several pillars and priorities of the 2022-2026 LAUSD Strategic Plan, including: High-Quality Instruction, College and Career Readiness, and Eliminating Opportunity Gaps (Pillar 1: Academic Excellence); Welcoming Learning Environments (Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness); Strong Relationships (Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration); and Modernize Infrastructure (Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness). 
 
Board Options and Consequences:   
Failure or delay of approval will postpone the execution and/or implementation of the proposed project and the associated benefits to the schools and students. 
 
Policy Implications:   
This action is consistent with the District’s long-term goal to address unmet school needs as described in Proposition BB and Measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. 
 
Budget Impact:   
The proposed project has a total budget of $166,288,260, all of which will come from Bond Program funding. The bond funds will be allocated from the “Technology Infrastructure and System Upgrades” SUP category of need. Upon completion of the project, no new funds will be needed to maintain the new systems deployed. 
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed project has the following outcomes and benefits that impact students: 
•                     Improved Reliability - Stronger network performance with less downtime and lower support costs. 
•                     Modernized Infrastructure - Replaces outdated cabling/equipment, supporting emergency communications and stakeholder connectivity.

This project will pilot a dark fiber ring - a network system that interconnects school networks to each other using fiber optic cabling across 44 school sites to provide redundant, high-availability connectivity and evaluate the feasibility, performance, and scalability of this alternative connectivity model to determine its potential for District-wide implementation. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On August 24, 2024, the Board of Education approved the update of the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure US funding and priorities (Board Rpt. 029-24/25), the next phase of the District's Bond Program, which will modernize, build, and repair school facilities to improve student health, safety and educational quality.  The Board's action approved the overarching goals and principles, funding sources, specific categories of need, and spending targets for the SUP.  As proposed projects are developed, they are submitted to the Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) for consideration and the Board of Education for approval.    
  
The SUP includes spending targets to address “Technology Infrastructure & System Upgrades.” The proposed project aligns with this SUP category. 
  
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:    
The School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC), at its December 11, 2025, meeting, considered this item.  Staff have concluded that this proposed SEP Amendment will facilitate the implementation of the ITS SEP, and therefore it will not adversely affect the District’s ability to successfully complete the ITS SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board will amend the ITS SEP to define the new project described herein and allocate $10,639,200 of Bond Program funding. This project will enable the District to provide redundant, high-availability connectivity across 44 selected school sites and determine how this resilient, cost-effective technology can enhance network redundancy and maintain continuous service in support of teaching, learning, and campus safety.  
   
Furthermore, this project directly contributes to achievement of several pillars and priorities of the 2022-2026 LAUSD Strategic Plan, including: High-Quality Instruction, College and Career Readiness, and Eliminating Opportunity Gaps (Pillar 1: Academic Excellence); Welcoming Learning Environments (Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness); and Modernize Infrastructure (Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness). 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure or delay of approval will postpone the execution and/or implementation of the proposed project and the associated benefits to the schools and students.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s long-term goal to address unmet school needs as described in Proposition BB and Measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US.
 
Budget Impact: 
The proposed project has a total budget of $10,639,200, all of which will come from Bond Program funding. The bond funds will be allocated from the “Technology Infrastructure & System Upgrades” SUP category of need.   
   
Upon completion of the project, $220,974 in new funds will be needed annually to maintain the new systems deployed.  These costs are anticipated to be paid from the Division’s existing budget.  
 
Student Impact:
The proposed project has the following outcomes and benefits that impact students:   
•                     Backup Connectivity - Maintains critical operations during primary WAN outages.    
•                     Future-Ready Technology - Introduces scalable, next-generation solutions aligned with long-term goals.    
•                     Reduced Downtime - Minimizes instructional and administrative disruptions from network outages.
•                     Pilot for Expansion - Provides a model to guide District-wide deployment of resilient, cost-effective connectivity.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approval of the consolidation of San Fernando Middle School and San Fernando Institute of Applied Media and the closure of the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media.
end
 
Body
Background: 
San Fernando Institute for Applied Media (SFiAM) and San Fernando Middle School (SFMS) are co-located on the same campus in Board District 6 and Region North, at 130 North Brand Blvd., San Fernando, CA, 91340. 
The demographic makeup of San Fernando is predominantly Hispanic/Latino, with a vibrant blend of cultural influences shaping the community. The city's demographic composition is as follows: Hispanic (93.2%), White (4.1%), Asian (1.7%), and Black (0.9%).  Approximately 33% of students at both schools are English Only students; 34.18% are RFEP- Reclassified Fluent English Proficient; 17.38% LEP-Limited English Proficient. 
 
The City of San Fernando is characterized by its strong sense of community and close-knit neighborhoods. The City of San Fernando and community are invested in the success of local public schools.
 
During the 2023-24 school year, the District received concerns regarding safety at SFMS. As a result, the District closely reviewed the school’s systems for operations, the academic program, and overall school culture. Region North, with support from several central office divisions, provided intensive support to stabilize student safety, and ultimately determined that leadership changes were necessary. At the end of March 2024, the Principal of SFiAM (alumnus and former teacher of SFMS) became the principal of SFMS. The Assistant Principal of SFiAM became the Principal of SFiAM. 
 
In order to ensure a high-quality educational program for all students at both SFMS and SFiAM, all personnel on campus increased collaboration, including strengthening operational and instructional systems and practices for the co-located site. Effective July 2025, both schools aligned their bell schedules and began sharing personnel, including an Assistant Principal, TSP Coordinator, PSA, and Psychiatric Social Worker. Both campuses already share a Plant Manager and Cafeteria Manager. Offices were also moved to the front of the school for students, faculty, staff, parents, and community members to have convenient access.
 
Extensive stakeholder engagement has occurred to explore potential consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM for strengthened enrollment, instruction, and safety. There were several rounds of meetings with staff, students and families in May 2024, October 2024, September 2025, October 2025, and November 2025. Feedback from these groups has informed this proposed consolidation, including new instructional programs such as a re-established Dual Language Spanish program and strengthened Career and Technical Education pathways. Throughout the engagement process, both principals of SFMS and SFiAM held joint faculty, classified, and parent meetings to seek input. The administrators at SFMS and SFiAM received supportive comments from families about the consolidation and new vision for the co-located schools. 
 
The District has noticed labor partners and committed to engage in bargaining any potential effects between now and July 1, 2026.
 
Academic and Programmatic Implications:
•                     The re-established Dual Language Spanish program will provide a much-needed articulation pattern for the City of San Fernando and local community. The Dual Language Education programs at five elementary feeder schools provide content and literacy instruction in English and in Spanish. San Fernando High School’s Dual Language Education program provides grade-level content and literacy instruction in two languages, in English and the target language, Spanish. This vital middle school linkage provides students with a residential pathway to foster bilingualism and bi-literacy. Expanded elective courses will be offered in Spanish, such as robotics, mariachi and other arts.
•                     Widening of their Career and Technical Education offerings with a “Farm to Table” initiative through Horticulture and Culinary Arts pathways provides students with robust career readiness experiences. Additionally, partnering with Mission College opens up academic opportunities as well as programmatic articulation with San Fernando HS.
 
Enrollment Implications:
•                     Both schools have experienced consistent declines in enrollment since 2018-2019. Contributing factors may include local demographic changes, increased competition among educational institutions, and residual effects of the pandemic. Continued focus on academic program development, community engagement, and strategic recruitment initiatives will be essential to sustaining and potentially increasing enrollment in future years.
o                     SFMS began the 2018-2019 school year with a norm day enrollment of 732 students. Enrollment steadily decreased in each subsequent year, with current enrollment of approximately 389 students.
o                     SFiAM experienced enrollment fluctuations during the same timeframe. The school’s overall enrollment has declined from 410 students in 2018-2019 with current enrollment of approximately 354 students.
•                     Per San Fernando Middle School Zone of Choice data (from SEPPO), there were significant findings:
o                     Students are not selecting either school (SFMS or SFiAM) at high rates. 
o                     Approximately 34% of resident Zone of Choice students who are still in district schools attend other choice options outside of the area (e.g. magnet programs).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the proposed action to consolidate SFMS and SFiAM and to close SFiAM as a separate school will leverage all resources-including human capital and school funding-in direct support of a high-quality, well-rounded, safe middle school option for the City of San Fernando and surrounding communities. 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote approves the consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM and the closure of the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media. 
 
A “NO” vote would result in maintaining two separate schools, SFMS and SFiAM, co-located on the same campus; overall, this may impact the District's ability to align resources to fortify the educational program.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
Since SFMS and SFiAM have already begun sharing personnel, an overall cost savings has been achieved. If official consolidation is approved, administrative and support positions will be carefully reviewed for potential redundancy and additional cost savings. If potential facilities improvements are requested and/or needed, Region North will need to identify additional funding sources, and work with the Facilities Services Division to scope the project. 
Student Impact:
The proposed action will provide students and families a high-quality, well-rounded, safe middle school option for the City of San Fernando and surrounding communities.
 
Equity Impact:
All students deserve access to high-quality, sustainable educational programs. By merging SFMS and SFiAM, the consolidated school will offer a more robust middle school program for students, including Dual Language Spanish, CTE, robotics, mariachi, and other elective options which will be available to all students in a safe school environment.
Issues and Analysis: 
No students will be displaced by this action. Consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM will strengthen improvement efforts for all students on this campus. The improvement of operational and instructional systems is underway, with clear improvement indicators for safety. As one school, educators-with support from the Educational Transformation Office and Region North-will develop cohesive plans, with benchmarks, to meet larger District goals and metrics.   
 
This decision is also informed by the financial and programmatic implications of declining enrollment and strategic alignment of resources. If the Board does not approve the closure of SFiAM, the two LAUSD schools, co-located on the same campus, will continue to operate separately, hindering improvement efforts.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, with middle level performance for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 520 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park is a TK-5 school currently serving 415 students on a District property pursuant to a lease agreement at 21425 Cohasset Street, Canoga Park, CA, 91303 in Board District 3 and Region North. N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on May 27, 2003.  On May 1, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 520 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 203-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts is a TK-5 school currently serving 394 students on four private facilities at 379 S. Loma Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; 345 S. Columbia Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; 375 S. Columbia Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; and 303 S. Loma Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90017 in Board District 2 and Region East. N.E.W.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Aspire Titan Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, with middle level performance for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 330 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Aspire Titan Academy is a TK-5 school currently serving 323 students on a private facility at 6720 S. Alameda Street, Huntington Park, CA, 90255 in Board District 5 and Region East.  Aspire Titan Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 330 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Aspire Titan Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, Aspire Titan Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Aspire Titan Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 201-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Goethe International Charter is a TK-8 span school currently serving 525 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-location site at 12500 Braddock Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90066 in Board District 4 and Region West. Goethe International Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on July 8, 2008.  On January 9, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 455 students in grades TK-5. On June 5, 2018, the Board of Education approved a request for material revision to increase enrollment up to 775 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Goethe International Charter expires June 30, 2026.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Port of Los Angeles High (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 7 and Region South, with high level performance for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 1,000 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Port of Los Angeles High is a 9-12 school currently serving 923 students on a private facility at 250 West 5th Street, San Pedro, CA, 90731 in Board District 7 and Region South. Port of Los Angeles High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 11, 2003.  On April 3, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 1,000 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Port of Los Angeles High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, Port of Los Angeles High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 16, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Port of Los Angeles High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 207-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Denial of the Renewal Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, a Middle performing, Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 6 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 300 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for New Horizons Charter Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 6 and Region North, with middle level performance and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy.
end
 
Body
Background: 
New Horizons Charter Academy is a TK-8 span school currently serving 132 students on a District campus at 6501 Fair Ave, North Hollywood, CA, 91601 in Board District 6 and Region North. New Horizons Charter Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 16, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 300 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Horizons Charter Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, New Horizons Charter Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current New Horizons Charter Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for New Horizons Charter Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that (1) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the renewal petition due to substantial fiscal and governance factors; and (2) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the renewal petition.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 205-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP.

Recommendation
Action Proposed:

end
 
Body
Background: 
New Millennium Secondary is a 9-12 school currently serving 96 students on a District campus at 182nd Street, Gardena, CA, 90248 in Board District 7 and Region South. New Millennium Secondary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 10, 2008.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 225 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Millennium Secondary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, New Millennium Secondary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current New Millennium Secondary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for New Millennium Secondary and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that (1) as a Middle Performing charter school, Charter School fails to meet or make sufficient progress toward meeting standards that provide a benefit to the pupils of the school; that closure of Charter School is in the best interest of pupils, and this decision to recommend denial provided greater weight to performance on measurements of academic performance; and (2) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the renewal petition.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 206-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD SELPA Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s LCFF funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

description
Whereas, For the 2024-25 school year the Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over 64,000 students receiving special education services, 33 percent of which have moderate-to-severe disabilities; 
 
Whereas, As the overall District enrollment declines, the share of students with disabilities has increased over the past two decades from 11.5 percent of the total student population in 2002-03 school year to approximately 16 percent in the 2025-26 school year; 
 
Whereas, The District provides 38 types of services and supports to students with disabilities in order to provide a free appropriate public education; 
 
Whereas, The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 (IDEA) by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states, local school districts, and taxpayers to pay for needed services, and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall, 
 
Whereas, In the 2025-2026 school year, the District plans to spend over $2 billion in special education costs, with the District’s federal IDEA funding falling woefully short of Congress’ commitment upon IDEA’s passage to 40 percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities; 
 
Whereas, The grossly inadequate level of funding for special education at both the federal and state level also does not sufficiently differentiate funding based on the severity of the student’s disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to fully meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities; 
 
Whereas, In 2021 the State established the Special Education Early Intervention Preschool Grant to provide early intervention services and supports to preschool-aged children with special needs who are at risk of falling significantly behind;
 
Whereas, The majority of the current state funding structure for special education is based on student attendance (AB 602) providing Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) funding based on their overall student attendance, regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide; 
 
Whereas, The District proudly operates 13 Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual student’s unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school; 
 
Whereas, Under a new proposal the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services instead of the U.S. Department of Education would assume responsibility for administering federally funded special education programs including the IDEA, raising serious concerns because the shift threatens to undermine critical oversight, accountability, and protections for students with disabilities; and 
 
Whereas, Special education services are further threatened by proposed reductions to medicaid, upon which many school districts depend to fund therapies, medical supports, services for students with disabilities. These cuts would disproportionately harm students with significant special needs and undermine their right to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE); now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families, particularly in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with disabilities; 
 
Resolved Further, That the District formally recognizes December 2 as National Special Education Day this year and every year and encourages all schools, students, and families to celebrate our children with disabilities and the unique assets they contribute to our school communities; 
 
Resolved Further, That the Board commits to continued advocacy for the protection of the IDEA and related Federal programs serving students with disabilities and for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the instructional programs and services for our students with disabilities, such as increasing California’s funding allocations to meet the increases in special education costs and Congress increasing the annual appropriations for the IDEA; and, be it finally 
 
Resolved, That the District commits to continuing and expanding upon its regular opportunities for parents and families students with disabilities to engage with the District to provide meaningful feedback, opportunities for continuous improvement and strengthen partnerships and resources.",Absent,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Whereas, National Mentoring Month 2026 will be celebrated from January 1 through January 31 to highlight the essential role mentoring plays in supporting academic achievement, social-emotional development, and long-term success for young people; 
 
Whereas, National Mentoring Month recognizes the invaluable contributions of mentors and raises awareness of how positive mentoring relationships strengthen students, families, schools, and communities; 
 
Whereas, Mentoring fosters positive life and social skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achievement and college access, supports career exploration, and nurtures youth leadership development;
 
Whereas, Research shows that youth with mentors are 92 percent more likely to volunteer regularly in their communities, 75 percent more likely to hold leadership positions in clubs or sports teams, 22 percent more likely to feel a strong sense of belonging during their upbringing, and 58 percent credit their mentor with supporting their mental health; 
 
Whereas, Mentoring demonstrates long-term effectiveness, with 74 percent of individuals who had a meaningful mentor reporting that their mentor significantly contributed to later life success, 85 percent saying their mentor helped them with school-related challenges, and nearly 60 percent of individuals under 40 continuing to draw advice from their childhood mentors; 
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes mentoring as a powerful tool for promoting educational equity, fostering resilience, closing opportunity gaps, and supporting the social and emotional well-being of all students; 
 
Whereas, The Beyond the Bell program provides enriching before- and after-school opportunities where students receive academic guidance, leadership development, and supportive relationships that often grow into meaningful mentoring connections; 
 
Whereas, Linked Learning pathways integrate rigorous academics with real-world experiences and mentorship from industry professionals in sectors such as engineering, healthcare, computer science, and the arts, preparing students for college, careers, and civic engagement; 
 
Whereas, GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) offers long-term, cohort-based mentoring and college readiness support for middle and high school students, helping them navigate academic challenges, build confidence, and prepare for postsecondary success; 
Whereas, The Foster Youth Achievement Program provides specialized support, advocacy, and mentorship to students in foster care, ensuring they receive the individualized guidance and stability needed to overcome systemic barriers and thrive academically and emotionally; 
 
Whereas, Federal budget proposals for fiscal year 2026 would eliminate funding for GEAR UP, among other student aid and mentoring/college-access programs;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that reductions in federal funding for mentoring and access programs would disproportionately affect students who benefit most from those services and undermine long-term equity and opportunity goals; and
 
Whereas, The District maintains strong partnerships with universities, nonprofit organizations, community-based agencies, and civic groups to expand mentoring opportunities across the District and ensure that all students have access to trusted, supportive role models; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes January 2026 as National Mentoring Month and encourages students, families, employees, community members, and partner organizations to participate in mentoring activities that empower youth and strengthen communities; 
 
Resolved further, That the District strongly advocates for the continued funding and expansion of mentoring and college-access programs, and urges federal, state, and local policymakers to ensure that these critical supports remain available to students in need; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District reaffirms its commitment to expanding, supporting, and promoting mentoring programs, partnerships, and opportunities that help young people realize their full potential and graduate ready for the world.",Absent,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Body
Background:

(2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and Multi-Year Projections) Recommends approval of the 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and Multi-Year Projections and its submission to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).
end
 
Recommendation
Actions Proposed: 
1.                     Approve the 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report, which contains a “positive” certification (enclosed herewith as “Attachment A”). In addition, authorize the submittal of the First Interim Financial Report to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).
2.                     Adopt a Resolution authorizing the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund in Fiscal Year 2027-28 (enclosed herewith as “Attachment B”). 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Under Education Code Sections 35035(i), 42130, and 42131, District staff must prepare and submit interim financial reports to the governing board at intervals throughout the fiscal year.  As part of the interim financial reports, the Board of Education (Board) certifies to the County Superintendent of Schools, the State Controller, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction whether the District is able to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the current fiscal year and the next two fiscal years, using one of three certification scenarios:
 
•                     A positive certification indicates that based on current projections, the District will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and two subsequent years.
•                     A qualified certification indicates that the District may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or two subsequent fiscal years.
•                     A negative certification indicates that the District will not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon approval by the Board, the District will file the First Interim Financial Report with the County Superintendent of Schools (CSS) and be in compliance with Education Code requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may accept the staff’s determination of a positive certification or approve the report with a modification of the revenue and expenditure projections.
 
CSS shall review the District’s certification. It has the authority and responsibility to change the certification if it determines that the District’s certification was not appropriate.  
 
In the event the District’s certification is other than positive at the first interim period, it must submit a proposal to the CSS that addresses the District’s fiscal conditions (“fiscal recovery plan”).  In addition, it may not, in that fiscal year or the next fiscal year, issue non-voter approved debt unless the CSS determines that the District shall probably make repayment of such debt issuance. Moreover, the CSS may also impose various restrictions on districts that fail to deal with financial issues raised in interim reports. Finally, rating agencies may consider interim reports when evaluating or revising credit ratings.
 
The Board may elect not to authorize the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund Other Than for Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund, thereby requiring other balancing solutions to maintain positive balances in the multi-year projection period.
 
Policy Implications: 
Board approval and submission of the District’s 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and ensures compliance with the Education Code and LACOE requirements. Furthermore, the authorization and balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund shall improve the District’s financial condition.
 
Budget Impact: 
This report maintains reserves at the required statutory level.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code requirements ensures that the District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.
 
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

3

District budgeting ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities”.  While some allocations of resources are district-wide, some investments such as Student Equity Need Index recognize historical inequities.



Resource Prioritization

3

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.



Results

3

Resources are allocated to the extent that it would support student needs, address priorities of achieving the District’s Strategic Plan.

Whereas, In October 2025, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency through a “Proclamation of Local Emergency for Federal Immigration Actions” in order to provide those most impacted with resources including economic relief, eviction protections, and other assistance; and in December 2024, LA City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance in to prohibit the use of city resources, personnel, property and data for federal immigration enforcement;
 
Whereas, Since the beginning of 2025, in Los Angeles and across the region, communities have witnessed heightened attacks on our most vulnerable communities, including Black, LGBTQ+, and immigrants, as a result of policies and rhetoric enacted by the federal administration; 
 
Whereas, As a result of those heightened attacks, Los Angeles Unified School District students and family members have been targeted, arrested, detained, and deported to their home countries within a matter of days;
 
Whereas, Communities are experiencing a widespread fear of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, detentions, and deportations near and around our schools consequently creating chaos and economic uncertainty as a result of family separations, job loss, housing destabilization, and movement across the region; 
 
Whereas, Recent immigration enforcement efforts have created fear, sorrow, and anxiety in our communities negatively impacting the mental health of young people. According to the 2025 BlueSky Youth Mental Health Survey, over 81 percent of youth respondents expressed concern with discrimination against immigrants;
 
Whereas, Particular communities across the greater Los Angeles region are being racially profiled and targeted. The map “Areas of Focus for Immigration Activity” produced by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) highlighted the communities of the San Fernando Valley (Pacoima and North Hills), South LA (Jefferson Park and Westmont), and Southeast LA (Norwalk, Bellflower, Downey, South Gate) as the communities with the highest immigration enforcement activity between June 6 and July 20, 2025;
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has reaffirmed its commitment to making Los Angeles Unified School District a sanctuary district through resolutions  “Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-093- 16/17), and “Reaffirm that Los Angeles Unified School District Will Be a Sanctuary District and Safe Zone for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-034-24/25); 
 
Whereas, In July of 2025, the Board unanimously approved the resolution “Upholding Our Constitutional Rights and Standing with Immigrant Communities” (Res-086-24/25) which condemns the militarization of immigrant communities, including any uninvited deployment of federal agents, National Guard personnel, in our schools and communities without local request and transparent civilian oversight;
 
Whereas, The District has responded by expanding the We Are One campaign, which includes regular Know Your Rights trainings, emergency preparedness plans, educating individuals of their civil rights when interacting with immigration enforcement officers, strengthening partnerships with community organizations and service providers, establishing and implementing protocols for when ICE attempts to enter our campuses, and other mental, financial and legal supports for impacted students and families;
 
Whereas, Community members, organizations and labor partners in the greater Los Angeles area have organized rapid response and mutual aid networks; organized and led Know Your Rights trainings for community members, students, and educators; documented ICE raids that have provided the basis for lawsuits against the federal administration; demonstrated a commitment to keeping our students safe by being present at schools during the first week of school; and communicating with board members and other District leaders to offer support;
 
Whereas, Through the unanimously approved “Community-Based Safety Analysis and Expansion” (Res-023-22/23) resolution, the District committed to implementing a holistic vision of school safety that called for a Community-Based Safety Pilot at Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP) schools incorporating safe passages, peacebuilding, and community development; and a Landscape Analysis Report produced by the Independent Analysis Unit to inform the expansion of community-based safety programs across the District;
 
Whereas, Community-Bbased Ssafety programs, when implemented with fidelity and accountability, can help to create inclusive, supportive, and safe learning environments for Black, undocumented immigrant, LGBTQ+ students without criminalizing or harming students; 
 
Whereas, The District allocated $125 million in base funding and an additional $50 million in one-time funding in the 2025-26 budget towards BSAP, which included funding to maintain and expand community-based safety program at BSAP schools;
 
Whereas, The District currently has over 170 active community-based safety programs, which include;: more than 75 safe passage programs, approximately 60 peace building programs, and nearly 40 community development programs across BSAP schools; and
 
Whereas, The District has recently executed separate Memorandaum of Understandings (MOU) with the Los County Office of Violence Prevention and the City of Los Angeles’s Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program (GRYD), leading to the initiation of a pilot safe passage program at Sotomayor Arts and Sciences Magnet, Bernstein High School and Virgil Middle School; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That in an effort to work towards creating a greater sense of safety on the route to and from school for students and families, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recommits to the model of Community-Based Safety, which includes safe passage, peacebuilding and community development programs;
 
Resolved further, That the Los Angeles Unified School District will utilize a community-based safety approach to its preparation and response related to neighborhood immigration enforcement through efforts that include:
•                     Expanding trainings for staff, students, and families on ICE protocols, Know Your Rights, de-escalation skill building, restorative justice, and peacebuilding, and potentially through the Every School Safe modules,
•                     Providing tailored guidance and training to school leadership teams on updating safety plans, practicing drills, and assessing campus facility security,
•                     Providing and enhancing communication about appropriate status updates and urgently needed resources like transportation and mental health services in response to community incidents; and,

Resolved further, That the Board affirms the role of school-based Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) and Restorative Practices (RP) in supporting community-based safety. The Board directs the District to conduct an evaluation of school-based PBIS and RP implementation, identify models with strong outcomes, and present findings and recommendations, including potential integration of PBIS/RP into community-based safety, at a School Climate and Safety Committee in Fall 2026; 
 
Resolved further, That the District will execute issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the a contract with an expert in the field of community-based safety by March 2026. As part of the contract, the expert will be hired to development of a cohesive plan for the expansion of community-based safety programs districtwide and target no later than May 2026 to present the contract and funding source(s) to the Board of Education for approval or ratification.;
