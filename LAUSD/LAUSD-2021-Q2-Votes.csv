Data from Los Angeles County shows COVID-19 deaths among Latinx residents increased over 1,000 percent between November 2020 January 2021. Life expectancy of Black and Latinx populations have declined by 2.7 and 1.9 years, respectively, compared to .8 years for the Anglo population;Whereas, Financial losses experienced by families in highest-need communities have resulted in some students taking additional responsibilities at home, including care-taker roles, teaching of younger siblings, and seeking out employment to contribute to the family’s basic needs;Whereas, Students in highest-need communities have expressed increased wellness needs to cope with factors such as additional responsibilities, grief due to loss of life from COVID-19, and a surge of gun violence in South L.A.;Whereas, The District has looked at these inequities in the past and has developed the Student Equity Needs Index (SENI) in order to assess and accurately identify schools that need the most support, allowing the District to differentiate investments and supports based on each school’s level of need;Whereas, Communities with Highest- and High-Need schools as identified by the SENI are experiencing an unprecedented crisis, evidenced by the death or illness of thousands and disproportionate economic impacts, including education, income, and housing as a result of COVID-19 and the digital divide;Whereas, Prior to this crisis, the District allocated $284 million to schools in 2020-21 through the SENI funding formula;Whereas, Increased education investments are associated with improved student outcomes;Whereas, Successful advocacy by the District and various community partners for additional state and federal funding to mitigate the significant impacts of COVID-19 will result in approximately $5 billion of projected additional state and federal funding being allocated to the District;Whereas, A significant portion of the District’s supplemental and concentration dollars are currently allocated to District-wide programs rather than school-based allocations;Whereas, Through an equity-based funding formula that uses a school’s rank on the SENI, the District can use new and existing funds to double a school’s funding, resulting in average increases in funding for the Highest- and High-need schools of approximately $850,000 for high schools, $720,000 for middle schools, and $300,000 for elementary schools;Whereas, This increase in funding would allow the Highest- and High-Need schools to reduce class sizes as well as invest in new counselors, psychiatric social workers, instructional coaches, and other intervention positions;Whereas, An increased investment in the SENI will ensure new and existing dollars intended to remediate the impact of COVID-19 and learning loss are distributed to schools proportionate to their needs; andWhereas, The District has already committed an additional $120 million ($404 million in total) to the SENI equity-based funding formula for the 2021-22 school year; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports the Community of Schools strategy to empower school leaders and leverage a community approach to accelerates progress in student outcomes;Resolved further, That the District will utilize an equity-based funding formula that uses a school’s rank on SENI and incorporates COVID-19 impact to allocate a minimum of $700 million, which will grow every year, of supplemental and concentration funding (an additional $298 million dollars over the proposed 2021-22 budget) to be known collectively as “SENI Funding”, and that a portion of the additional funding will allow per pupil SENI funding for elementary students to rise to a level commensurate with SENI funding levels for secondary students;Resolved further, That this additional SENI Funding shall be in addition to, rather than replace any existing equity-based spending or programs that currently benefit schools;Resolved further, That the funds previously reserved as “hold harmless” to allow for a stable transition to the current SENI formula will go towards the increase in the SENI funding, excepting that options schools will not receive reduced funding as a result of this resolution until such time as an alternative funding plan for option schools is developed; Resolved further, That the District commits to an equitable distribution of COVID-19 relief funds and other intervention funding, determined by COVID’s impact on the community, SENI, and other factors;Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall prioritize the allocation of funds be directly to schools based on identified student needs and provide the Board with an accounting of how increased funding is allocated to schools across the District as part of the annual budgeting process;Resolved further, That the District shall ensure full transparency regarding the SENI formula and any new student-centered funding formulas, and the development of those formulas, that includes providing the following data in a downloadable Excel spreadsheet format available to the public:•	The pupil count, percentage count, and other rates of factors for every need indicator in the Student Equity Needs Index for each individual school in the District;•	The calculations based upon each of those need indicators for each school that goes into determining the SENI Score for that school;•	The calculations that aggregate those need indicators for each individual school;•	The methodology and calculations used based upon this data to determine the per- pupil allocation to each school;·Resolved further, That at the end of each school fiscal year the District shall provide a public accounting for every school in the District of how much SENI money was actually received and how it was spent.Resolved further, That the Superintendent will convene a task force to gather meaningful community input to inform the development of a support and evaluation plan for student outcomes as a result of SENI investments. The plan should be presented to the Board and public by June 2022. The plan should identify 1) how the District will measure the impact of SENI funding on student outcomes, 2) what support and assistance will be provided to school sites receiving funding to facilitate the effective and equitable use of SENI funding, and 3) what additional and targeted budgeting support will be implemented for schools, communities of schools, or local districts that do not improve student outcomes starting in 2022-23.  Updates shall be provided to the Board and the public on a periodic basis, not less than annually; and, be it finally Resolved, That the ongoing Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) cycle will incorporate the above resolutions as part of the forthcoming LCAP.",FileMaker Resolutions DB,2021-05-11,Monica Garcia,Tanya Ortiz Franklin; Kamarie Brown,Kamarie Brown: Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes

Establishing a strong foundation in the quality and quantity of early childhood education spaces rooted in social justice values essentially recognizes and respects the human rights of children in regards to their identity, agency, and integrity; Whereas, Research shows that students who participate in high-quality Early Childhood Education programs are less likely to be placed in Special Education programs (8.1 percentage points), be retained (8.3 percentage points), more likely to graduate from high school (11.4 percentage points) than their peers who did not participate in such programs and that providing families who otherwise would not have received access to high-quality Early Childhood Education programs is an effective means for breaking the cycle of poverty; Whereas, As of the 2019-20 school year the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Early Childhood Education Division served over 20,000 students from infants to 5 year olds in high- quality programs such as CalSafe, Expanded Transitional Kindergarten, Early Education Centers, California State Preschool Programs and Preschool Collaborative Classrooms, providing children with exceptional foundational skills and enabling they District’s highest- needs families to advance their education or pursue job opportunities; Whereas, Data show that students enrolled in the District’s Early Childhood Education programs are more likely to have better attendance in Kindergarten, demonstrate earlier Kindergarten readiness and more advanced literacy development on the Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP), if eligible for special education services, more likely to transition to the general education settings, as well as promote English Learner reclassification while preserving students’ emerging bilingualism; Whereas, A well-supported public education is the foundation for assuring a well-educated and engaged citizenry;Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously approved the resolution Creating a Birth to Eight Roadmap for Success in Los Angeles (Res 020- 17/18) which resulted in the creation of a plan for the District’s youngest learners to achieve developmentally appropriate social-emotional skills and academic success, ultimately eliminating achievement gaps before third grade; Whereas, The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the fundamental inequities rooted in the communities the District serves, and long-term recovery necessitates investments in effective high-yielding strategies, such as universal high-quality early childhood education programs, which have been proven effective and beneficial to students, families, teachers, schools, and local economies; and Whereas, Governor Newsom’s Early Learning and Care Master Plan (December 2020) serves as a framework to realize the vision that by 2030 all children in California are able to thrive physically, emotionally, and educationally in their early years through access to high-quality early learning and care resources, with opportunities for the workforce that advance equitable outcomes for children, and greater efficiencies through structures for continuous improvement; now, therefore, be it Resolved, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes that Early Childhood Education programs are an essential investment in closing both the opportunity and readiness gap, particularly in historically underserved communities and affirms its intent to ensure every child, ages 3-5, in Los Angeles has a seat in a high-quality Early Childhood Education program, prioritizing our highest needs communities and in collaboration with non- profit and community providers, by the 2024-25 school year. Resolved further, That the Superintendent is directed to develop a comprehensive plan, in collaboration with early education providers, advocates, and community stakeholders, presented to the Board in 180 days, guided by the following pillars: 1.	High-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive, and developmentally appropriate teaching and learning that is free of implicit-bias and reflects vertical alignment from preschool to the primary grades;2.	Equitable implementation that prioritizes dual language learners, Black students, children with disabilities, families experiencing homelessness, children involved in the child welfare system, and historically underserved communities; 3.	Robust career pathways and targeted professional development that is responsive to the needs of children and educators, fosters innovation, implements critical pedagogy and bridges the PreK-3 continuum;4.	Meaningful partnerships with community and home providers as well as support services that address the needs of the whole child; 5.	Authentic, asset-based family engagement that nurtures family wellbeing, supports children’s learning, strengthens family-teacher partnerships, and empowers families with ongoing learning and development opportunities; and6.	Innovative approaches to funding, program development, implementation and delivery; Resolved further, That the Superintendent’s plan shall prioritize the following strategies, to the extent feasible, in order to achieve the goal of universal preschool by the 2024-25 school year: ●	High quality teaching and learning:○	Providing Early Transitional Kindergarten (ETK) on every elementary school campus ○	Becoming a Head Start and Early Head Start program grantee via the Federal Office of Head Start, within the Administration of Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services○	Investing developmentally appropriate teaching practices, curriculum and professional development, including anti-bias and inclusive approaches, as well as developmentally appropriate teacher-child ratios across various programs●	Equitable implementation:○	Use an equity-based approach to re-open closed Early Education Centers and Infant Centers, prioritizing serving parenting Los Angeles Unified School District students  ○	Expansion of the Dual Language Early Education pilot, prioritizing communities with high populations of Dual Language Learners, Black students, and low-income families, to build vertically articulated P-12 Dual Language pathways and promote biliteracy putting students on the path to attainment of the State Seal of Biliteracy○	Expansion of pre-school collaborative classrooms (PCC) to further the District’s inclusion initiatives, including reducing the over-identification of Black students, and other over-identified student groups, for Special Education services○	Expansion of Preschool for All Learners (PALS) classrooms, with a focus on those Communities of Schools that have historically high concentrations of students with moderate to severe disabilities○	Explore opportunities to support District employees who are parents with young children through engaging staff on best approaches to ensure they have access to early learning and care for their children●	Robust professional development and career pathways:○	Investing in professional development for early education teachers, including developing micro-credentialing opportunities for existing teachers, supporting practitioners who seek to obtain a credential, and the creation of the pathways for aspiring early education aides who wish to become credentialed teachers○	Vertically articulated professional development opportunities that are incorporated into Elementary professional development cycles●	Meaningful partnerships:○	Collaborating with non-profit licensed community and home-based Early Childhood Providers in a mixed-delivery system to ensure universal access ○	Partnering with Los Angeles County early childhood leaders on building support systems for children, families and early childhood educators (e.g. identifying access gaps, whole child/family support services, etc)●	Authentic, asset-based family engagement:○	Leading meaningful school-family partnerships that promote authentic, asset-based, culturally and linguistically responsive family engagement○	Encouraging and supporting meaningful family engagement practices (regular communication between staff and families, opportunities for parents to visit and volunteer in the classroom, hiring staff who speak parents’ home language and providing communications and resources in parents’ home language, etc)○	Support schools to engage families proactively and consistently in a two-way conversation about needs, goals, and support for their students (e.g. additional time/staff support for educator/family conversations)○	Incorporating early childhood family engagement opportunities and workshops into the Parent and Community Services Branch ○	Creation of a robust marketing and outreach plan to ensure families are aware of the District’s expanded program offerings in collaboration with the larger Los Angeles early childhood community●	Innovative approaches, including but not limited to: ○	Leveraging underutilized/under-enrolled spaces on district sites for program expansion and growing enrollment and utilizing facilities bond dollars, to the extent feasible○	Integrating support services to meet the needs of the whole child and promote family well-being○	Integrating the District’s eSIS system into the Whole Child Data Platform  ○	Explore opportunities for moderate income families, such as sliding scale approach;Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall prioritize expanding both Transitional Kindergarten (TK) and Early Transitional Kindergarten (ETK) programs, utilizing both Federal and State COVID-19 relief funds, to ensure program offerings are equitably distributed across District sites without ETK or TK starting in the 2021-22 school year, as well as re-opening previously closed Early Education Centers to be fully operational no later than the 2024-25 school year;Resolved further, That the developed plan shall also identify potential funding streams (local, state, federal, grant and philanthropic) and legislative advocacy efforts necessary to fully execute the plan; and, be it finallyResolved, That the Office of Government Relations shall continue to advocate for additional resources at the local, state and federal level to sustainably expand the District’s current program offerings including pursuing funding in support of universal preschool as part of the upcoming Federal appropriations process and the District taking an official support position on AB-22, AB-92, SB-50, SB-70, SB-246,
