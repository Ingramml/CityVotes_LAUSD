Approval of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Scholar Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Scholar Academy (“Charter School”), with a benchmark in the area of academic, located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2030, to serve to up to serve 450 students in grades 5-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
KIPP Scholar Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 437 students on a private facility at 6100 S. Hoover Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90044 in Board District 1 and Region South. KIPP Scholar Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Scholar Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Scholar Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Scholar Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 156, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Philosophers Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 7 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve up to 450 students in grades 5-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
KIPP Philosophers Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 395 students on a private facility at 1999 E. 102nd Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90002, in Board District 7 and Region South. KIPP Philosophers Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Philosophers Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Philosophers Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division, seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition.

To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m).

(Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Corazón Academy (“Charter School”), with benchmarks in the areas of academics, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve 1042 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term.

Charter School’s currently authorized enrollment capacity is 1,042. As part of Charter School’s renewal petition submission, Charter School included an increase of 100 students from 1,042 to 1,142. At the same time as the renewal petition submission, Charter School submitted its material revision application seeking to increase its enrollment capacity from 1,142 to 1,205 students and add a location. However, pursuant to the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, Charter School’s material revision application did not contain the information and/or documents necessary to begin processing. As such, Staff cannot process Charter School’s material revision application at this time. Staff has communicated to Charter School that the District will consider its material revision request when appropriately submitted. Staff recommends the renewal of Charter School’s petition with the currently authorized enrollment capacity of 1,042. 
 
Background: 
KIPP Corazón Academy is a TK-8 school currently serving 1055 students on two private facilities at 9325 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, and 8616 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, in Board District 5 and Region East. KIPP Corazón Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Corazón Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Corazón Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Corazón Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 154, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science and Technology Charter Middle [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle. The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 240 to 180 students. 
 
Background: 
Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle is a 5-8 school currently serving 86 students on a private facility at 15355 Morrison Street, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91403 in Board District 3 and Region North. Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2007.  On January 10, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 240 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 16, 2024, Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 14, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 153, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition     
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of Procurement Actions
January 14, 2025
Procurement Services Division 
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of  award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed in Attachment “B.”
 
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts.
 
 
Student Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See attached for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form.

Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions
January 14, 2025
Procurement Services Division - Facilities Contracts
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services/amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approve the proposed contract listed in Attachment B including a Major Modernization Project contract at Fairfax High School.
 
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013, Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
 
 
 
Student Impact: 
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report, Adoption of the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School Major Modernization Project
January 14, 2025
Office of Environmental Health & Safety
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Review and certify the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the proposed Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School Major Modernization Project (Project) prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) and State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 §15000 et seq.).
 
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning and feasibility activities necessary to propose scope recommendations, budget and schedule for the proposed Project (Board Report No. 085-21/22). Subsequently, on November 15, 2022, the Board approved the project redefinition for the proposed Project to begin the environmental review, design, procurement and other activities necessary to implement the proposed Project (Board Report No. 074-22/23). 
 
The proposed Project is located within the 11.18-acre school campus at 3010 Estara Avenue within the Glassell Park/Los Feliz neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles (Board District 5, Region West). Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School (School) opened in 1937. All existing buildings were constructed between 1937 and 2004.  The campus has been identified eligible as a historic district due to its depiction of a post-Long Beach Earthquake middle school campus that embodies Los Angeles Unified school planning and design concepts of the period and is an example of PWA (Public Works Administration) Moderne architecture applied to a middle school campus. The Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building, Homemaking Building and five relocatable buildings are identified as being located on an earthquake fault. As of the 2023-2024 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the School served approximately 800 students in grades 6 through 8 and the projected enrollment for planning purposes is 750 students.
 
The proposed Project will construct new facilities, including a two-story Classroom Building with 19 general and specialty classrooms and support spaces, library, student store and administration spaces; a one-story Maintenance & Operations Building with office and support spaces; and a one-story City of Angels Building with 2 general classrooms and support spaces. The proposed Project also includes the seismic retrofit of the existing Auditorium and infrastructure upgrades to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The proposed Project will reduce the School’s current capacity and total number of classrooms from 65 to 46 classrooms based on the planned/projected enrollment.
 
 
 
The proposed Project includes the demolition of three permanent buildings (two-story Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building and one-story Homemaking Building) and six relocatable buildings. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impact during construction. 
 
The proposed Project also includes utility upgrades; a campus-wide fire alarm upgrade; Internet Protocol (IP) convergence; new parking areas; new outdoor learning environments; the removal and replacement of trees; landscaping and irrigation; hardscaping; fencing, gates and site furnishings. 
 
The Campus is not on any hazardous waste site lists under Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. A Preliminary Environmental Assessment-Equivalent (PEA-E) was conducted for the proposed Project in accordance with the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) guidelines. A Soil Removal Plan (SRP) would be implemented as part of the proposed Project to address the removal of contaminated soil. Similar reports would be prepared to address suspect asphalt and building materials encountered during construction. There is no direct student or staff exposure to the impacted soils since the affected soils are under asphalt pavement or will be off-limits. The SRP would ensure students and staff are not exposed to impacted soils during the removal work.   
 
The District’s Office of Environmental Health & Safety (OEHS) evaluated the proposed Project to determine its potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA, Public Resources Code §21000, et seq., and State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations §15000 et seq. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study, resulted in the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (State Clearinghouse Number 2023120006). The Draft EIR focused on seven environmental areas: air quality; cultural resources; greenhouse gas emissions; hazards and hazardous materials; noise and pedestrian safety and transportation and traffic. The analysis documented in the Draft EIR found that the proposed Project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts to cultural resources. A Statement of Overriding Considerations by the Board for this impact will therefore be required. 
 
The Draft EIR also evaluated two alternatives to the proposed Project: (1) No Project/No Development and (2) Retain Entire Administration Building (the Administration Building would remain as-is while other components of the project would proceed). Other alternatives that would rehabilitate or retain a portion of the Administration Building were determined to be infeasible and not further evaluated in the EIR. Both alternatives would result in fewer environmental impacts compared to the proposed Project. However, neither of them meet most of the District’s objectives for the School Upgrade Program or the Project-specific objectives for the proposed Project. 
 
The Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period from September 16, 2024 through October 31, 2024. Copies of the Draft EIR, PEA-E and SRP were available for review electronically on the OEHS website and on the State Clearinghouse website. Printed copies were also made available for public review at OEHS District Headquarters at Beaudry and at Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School.
 
The Notice of Availability of Draft EIR (Notice of Availability or NOA) was posted on the OEHS website during the public review period, mailed the NOA to all owner/occupants located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Project site, to parents/guardians of students and published the NOI in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The NOA was filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk and with the State Clearinghouse for distribution to potentially affected state agencies, and the District mailed copies of the NOA directly to potentially affected state agencies, local agencies, tribal agencies pursuant to AB 52 and known interested parties. 
 
During the public review period, a community meeting was held on October 17, 2024, to provide information about the Project and receive comments on the Draft EIR. The community meeting was advertised along with the NOA through direct mailing to occupants within 0.25-mile of the Project site, door-to-door distribution of event flyers and in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The meeting included an overview of the proposed Project and the contents and findings of the Draft EIR and gave faculty, staff, agencies, organizations, parents/guardians and community members the opportunity to make verbal and written comments on the Project and the Draft EIR.
 
At the end of the public review period, the District received three comment letters from members of the community and verbal comments from individuals during the community meeting. All letters and verbal comments were responded to by the District and are included in the Final EIR, which was circulated for a 10-day agency review period beginning on December 16, 2024. 
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053 and the Board shall review and consider the attached Resolution which certifies the Final EIR and adopts the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the proposed Project.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will review and make a determination on the attached Resolution to certify the Final EIR, adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations, pursuant to CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This action is required for the Board to consider approving the proposed Project.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “yes” vote to certify the Final EIR and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations would enable the LAUSD to proceed with the proposed Project as proposed in the Final EIR.  A vote of “no” to certify the Final EIR and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations would prevent the Board from approving the proposed Project and the proposed Project could not proceed into design and construction.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project, once completed, will help ensure that the students attending the school are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.
 
 
 
 
 
Equity Impact:
The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified’s reliance on relocatable buildings and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows the District to reach more schools with the limited funding available.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Environmental review of the proposed Project found that, with the incorporation of District Standards and Specifications, mitigation measures, as well as all applicable state, federal and local regulations, there would be significant impacts related to cultural resources as a result of the proposed Project. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study and Draft EIR, resulted in the preparation of the Final EIR, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations. 
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in the State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053, and the Board shall review and consider the MND, MMRP and its supporting documents and comments.

Project Approval for the Washington Irving Middle School Math Music Engineering Magnet Major Modernization Project
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the proposed Washington Irving Middle School Math Music Engineering Magnet Major Modernization Project (Project). 
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments to implement the proposed Project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety’s (OEHS) evaluation of the proposed Project resulted in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, staff is requesting the Board of Education (Board) approve the proposed Project so that construction activities can commence at a later date. The proposed action may only be considered after the Board certifies the EIR prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project.     
 
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary to propose scope recommendations, budget, and schedule for the proposed Project. Subsequently, on November 15, 2022, the Board approved the project redefinition for the proposed Project to begin the environmental review, design, procurement, and other activities necessary to implement the proposed Project. 
 
The proposed Project is located within the 11.18-acre school campus at 3010 Estara Avenue within the Glassell Park/Los Feliz neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles (Board District 5, Region West). Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School (School) opened in 1937. All existing buildings were constructed between 1937 and 2004.  The campus has been identified eligible as a historic district due to its depiction of a post-Long Beach Earthquake middle school campus that embodies Los Angeles Unified school planning and design concepts of the period and is an example of PWA (Public Works Administration) Moderne architecture applied to a middle school campus. The Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building, Homemaking Building and five relocatable buildings are identified as being located on an earthquake fault. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the School served approximately 900 students in grades 6 through 8 and the projected enrollment for planning purposes is 750 students.
 
The proposed Project will construct new facilities, including a two-story Classroom Building with 19 general and specialty classrooms and support spaces, library, student store and administration spaces; a one-story Maintenance & Operations Building with office and support spaces; and a one-story City of Angels Building with 2 general classrooms and support spaces. The proposed Project also includes the seismic retrofit of the existing Auditorium and infrastructure upgrades to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The proposed Project will reduce the School’s current capacity and total number of classrooms from 65 to 46 classrooms based on the planned/projected enrollment.
 
The proposed Project includes the demolition of three permanent buildings (two-story Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building and one-story Homemaking Building), and six relocatable buildings. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impact during construction. 
 
The proposed Project also includes utility upgrades; a campus-wide fire alarm upgrade; Internet Protocol (IP) convergence; new parking areas; new outdoor learning environments; the removal and replacement of trees; landscaping and irrigation; hardscaping; fencing, gates, and site furnishings. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the proposed Project will permit construction activities to be undertaken once the Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval is secured. Construction activities related to the construction of new buildings are anticipated to begin in the third quarter of 2026, and site/utility/interim facilities activities may begin in advance of this work, in an earlier phase. Construction is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2030.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of staff’s proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured. If the proposed action is not adopted, staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities. As a result, the School will continue to operate with aging, deteriorating, and outdated buildings and grounds and will continue to have students in buildings located on an earthquake fault. Furthermore, students, staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.
 
Budget Impact: 
The proposed action does not have a budget impact as the Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it adopted the project definition. The current budget for the proposed Project is $173,355,078. The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.  
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will help ensure that approximately 900 existing and future students attending the school are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.
 
Equity Impact:
The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified’s reliance on relocatable buildings, and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the proposed Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows Los Angeles Unified to reach more schools with the limited funding available.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of an EIR. The EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period from September 16, 2024, to October 31, 2024. The analysis documented in the EIR found that the proposed Project would result in significant environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction, the Board must certify the EIR and subsequently must approve the proposed Project.

Define and Approve Seven Playground and Campus Exterior Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve seven Playground and Campus Exterior Upgrade Projects (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $93,047,853.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework and approved the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) to help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. The Implementation Plan included, among other things, the development of playground and campus exterior upgrade projects within the category of need for Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components. These proposed Projects will address the most deteriorated paving conditions and transform playground areas.
 
The proposed Projects include, but are not limited to, greening and landscaping improvements throughout the campus to meet the District’s goal of schoolyards to be 30% green/natural, paving replacement in playgrounds and other areas, solar reflective coating in playgrounds, privacy fencing where needed, exterior painting of all buildings and structures, and accessibility upgrades, as described in Exhibit A.
 
Additionally, the proposed project at Dolores Street Elementary School (Dolores) will incorporate Bond Program funds earmarked in the Implementation Plan for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan Implementation. On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan (Transition Plan) under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan identified program accessibility upgrades as a priority at Dolores and these have been incorporated into the Project as described in Exhibit A.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the BOC and the Board of Education (Board), the District provided the BOC with the opportunity to consider the bond funded proposal and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to approve or disapprove the proposal, prior to presenting the item to the Board for final action. Following discussion, a vote was taken which resulted in 5 ayes, 4 nays, 1 abstention, and 3 absences, as referenced in Exhibit B. Having fulfilled the requirements under the MOU, and after further review with staff, the proposal will proceed to the Board without a BOC recommendation. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt this proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the seven proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, and RR. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and playground and campus exterior upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing playground and campus exterior upgrades at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined budget for the seven proposed Projects is $93,047,853. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
The $27,861,742 budget for the proposed Project at Dolores includes $8,215,000 for accessibility upgrades. Bond Program funds targeted for the ADA Transition Plan Implementation will be transferred to funds earmarked in the SUP for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed Project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure more than 3,000 current and future students attending the seven schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities Condition Assessment data identified schools with the worst paving condition based on age, aesthetics, deterioration, health and safety concerns, and weighting factors for paving condition and the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index was applied to achieve an equitable distribution to prioritize schools across the District for development of a proposed Project.
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Define and Approve Two Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein 
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve two projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed projects is $6,366,108.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes a project to provide roofing replacement at Thomas A. Edison Middle School and a project to provide stormwater system replacement at Verdugo Hills High School. 
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve two projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the two proposed projects is $6,366,108 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 2,000 current and future students attending these two schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Authorization to Finalize Negotiations and Execute a Renewal License Agreement for Use of Radio Tower Space at Palos Verdes 1, Rancho Palos Verdes CA
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s), to execute a renewal license agreement (Agreement), and/or any other reasonable instruments, with American Tower Asset Sub, LLC, for an existing remote tower space located at 3690 East Crest Road in Rancho Palos Verdes. The tower provides radiofrequency transmission used for the radio communication system which is accessed by Los Angeles Unified School District (District) staff and operations in the southern portion of the District. The Agreement provides for a five-year term with three options to renew the term for a period of five years each. The total base rent of this Agreement over the total five-year term is $1,027,743.97.
 
Background: 
The District’s radio communications are dependent upon antennas and microwave dishes attached to fixed radio towers located on multiple sites in and around Los Angeles County. Information Technology Services (ITS) and Los Angeles School Police Department (LASPD) have licensed a portion of the radio tower at 3690 East Crest Road since 1997, which was selected for its location and elevation to provide radio coverage to LASPD, Transportation Services Branch school bus operations, Facilities Services Division Maintenance and Operations, KLCS Public Media, the Gardena Bus Garage, several secondary schools, and a nutrition center in the South Bay area. Since the existing license agreement expired on August 1, 2024, the agreement has been operating and will operate on a month-to-month basis until a renewal agreement is executed.
 
The proposed Agreement has a five-year term with three (3) options to renew the term, each renewal term is for a period of five (5) years. The monthly base rent in the first year of the term will be $15,785.68 and will be subject to an annual fixed increase of 4%.  All other terms from the existing license agreement will apply to the renewal agreement.  
 
The District is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide coverage using this site.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approve and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Agreement and/or other reasonable instruments for tower space at Palos Verdes 1. The proposed Agreement will allow continued, safe, effective, reliable radio communication, which benefits all students and offices.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If approved, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will execute agreements necessary to keep radiofrequency transmission open for District communications.
 
If the Board does not approve and authorize the proposed action, radio communication transmission from Palos Verdes 1 will no longer be made available and an alternative site will have to be identified to ensure that radio communication lines remain open. Any new site selected must be able to provide the same or better quality of radio coverage consistent with the current location and will require all radio tower equipment to be realigned and cleared for operation by both the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation
Administration prior to use.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested action is consistent with current District policy and advances the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by continuing to provide use of radio tower space to support the District’s radio communication infrastructure.
 
Budget Impact: 
The first year of the Agreement will be for a monthly base rent payment of $15,785.68. For each subsequent year, the base rent will increase by 4%. The proposed monthly rent is comprised of direct costs and market-based rent inclusive of, but not limited to, utilities, taxes, tower height, capacity, and administration of the Agreement. In the first year of the Agreement, the annual rent for the proposed use is anticipated to be approximately $189,428.20. The following chart shows the anticipated annual rent for each year of the term:

Landlord: American Tower Asset Sub, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company
 
Rentable Area: Remote Tower Space and Radio Shelter 
 
Term: Five years and three options to extend the term for a period of five years each term
 
Previous Base Rent: $151,617.03 annually
 
Proposed Base Rent: Monthly base rent for one year is $15,785.68 and is subject to the annual adjustment of 4% 
 
The total base rent of this Agreement over the five-year term is $1,027,743.97. Funding will be provided by the General Fund, Program Code 15125.
 
Student Impact: 
The continued Agreement for the remote tower space will provide reliable radio-frequency bands for daily operations and provide information to help create safe secure environments for students across the District.
 
Equity Impact:
The existing radio tower space will be able to provide coverage to support District school police vehicles, school buses, truck operations, schools, and offices.
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The tower at Palos Verdes #1 has served the daily radio operations of the District since 1997. Given the ground terrain, elevation, slope, and tower infrastructure, staff finds the present site to be optimal to support current radio transmission needs.

Define and Approve 16 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein 
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 16 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $795,482.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024, as reference in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the school and its students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 16 proposed projects is $795,482. Eight projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects. Eight projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 8,800 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact:
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a no vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  A no vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.

Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 12 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
 
Background:

The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed. During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit. Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new as multiple subject, special education, mathematics, and English teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits. Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact: 
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom. In areas of high need such as multiple subject, special education, mathematics, and English, where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Request for Board Approval of Education Compact with the City of Lomita
January 14, 2025
Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Education Compact with the City of Lomita.
 
Background: 
As part of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan for the Los Angeles Unified School District, new Education Compacts are to be established between the District and local governmental entities. Education Compacts with the municipal governments are intended to align resources and implement innovative programs to equip our students with the tools they need to be Ready for the World.
 
Through these Education Compacts, each city and the District will collaborate to meet the educational needs of youth and families in the respective city through the end of the District’s Strategic Plan (June 2026). The city and the District may choose to revisit the Compact after June 2026 to renew their shared commitments 
to students and families.
 
The commitments outlined in the Education Compact are not legally binding nor do they mandate budgetary expenditures on behalf of the Parties. They represent a shared philosophical goal of improving the educational opportunities and enriching the lives of children and families attending District sites living within the city. 
 
The Office of Governmental Relations (OGR) will continue discussions with other municipalities to finalize Education Compacts that can be brought forth for Board approval at a future meeting.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approved Education Compacts will result in a coherent agenda that OGR, Region Offices and the respective District Divisions will promote and advance by strengthening collaboration with each municipality to deliver on the commitments outlined in the shared vision. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval will allow OGR, Region Offices and the respective District Divisions to proceed in a timely manner to deliver on the commitments outlined in the shared vision. Delay in approval will delay the opportunity to strengthen these partnerships.
 
Policy Implications: 
The Education Compacts are in alignment with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Budget Impact: 
No budgetary expenditures are outlined in the Education Compacts.
 
Student Impact: 
The Education Compact supports students and families through strengthening partnerships between the city and the District. Such partnership ensures a coherent and joint effort to support student success. 
 
Equity Impact:

Score Rationale

 



Recognition

     3

 

The Education Compacts may establish partnerships between the District and the City of Los Angeles as well as the smaller and less representative cities and communities that also serve our student population. While approximately around 21% of Los Angeles Unified students attend schools outside of the City of Los Angeles, it is equally important for the District to continue to pursue collaborative efforts with the other cities and unincorporated communities represented by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

 



Resource Prioritization

     3

 

Pursuing these partnerships would mean that our programs and initiatives are also being replicated in other communities outside the City of Los Angeles, ultimately broadening opportunities and services to students and families in a more equitable way. 

 



Results

     2

 

The Education Compacts represent a shared philosophical goal of improving the educational opportunities and enriching the lives of children and families attending District sites within respective cities and unincorporated communities, however the commitments are not legally binding, nor do they mandate financial obligations.

Proposition 39 Charter Facilities Compliance for the 2025-2026 School Year - Finding and Written Statements of Reasons Why Certain Charter Schools Cannot be Accommodated on a Single School Site, and Determination of Necessity to Move 
January 14, 2025
Office of the Chief Strategy Officer
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Find and adopt, pursuant to California Education Code section 47614 and its implementing regulations (“Regulations”), a written statement of reasons why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) that submitted a Proposition 39 facilities request for the 2025-2026 school year cannot be accommodated on a single school site. Also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
Background: 
With the passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000, California Education Code section 47614 (“Proposition 39”) was amended with the intent that public school facilities should be shared fairly among all public-school pupils, including those in charter schools.
 
Proposition 39 requires that school districts make available to each charter school operating in the school district, facilities that will accommodate all of the charter school’s in-district students. The facilities must be in conditions “reasonably equivalent” to those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other public schools of the district, and the school district may not move a charter school unnecessarily. For each legally sufficient facilities request submitted by a charter school to a school district, the Regulations require the school district to deliver to the charter school a preliminary proposal on or before February 1st, and a final offer on or before April 1st. 
 
The Board of Education has authorized the Superintendent (and/or their designee(s)) to issue preliminary proposals and final offers of space to all charter schools that submitted legally sufficient facilities requests, for the specific school year at issue, in accordance with requirements and timelines of Proposition 39 and the Regulations. (Board Report No. 098 - 18/19, dated October 2, 2018.)
 
The District is prepared to make preliminary proposals and final offers of space at operating District school sites to all eligible charter school applicants. While most preliminary proposals and final offers will accommodate charter schools at a single school site, some will accommodate certain charter schools (identified in the Attachments hereto) at more than one school site.
 
Section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations provides that if a school district’s preliminary proposal or final offer of space does not accommodate a charter school at a single school site, the district’s governing board must first: (i) make a finding that the charter school cannot be accommodated at a single site; and (ii) adopt a written statement of the reasons explaining the finding.
The charter schools identified in the Attachments hereto cannot be accommodated at a single site because of several factors, such as:  the large number of seats identified in the charter school’s facilities request, the lack of available classrooms on a single site in the specific area requested by the charter school, multiple charter schools’ requests for facilities at the same school site or in the same area, and/or the charter school’s request to be located at more than one school site.  In addition to design capacity and geographical limitations, and consistent with the Proposition 39 Charter Schools Co-Location Policy (Board Report No. 200 - 23/24, dated March 19, 2024), the District gave substantial consideration to District and charter students’ safety and welfare, including, but not limited to, the disproportionate harm to District students that would result from forcibly dislocating children from their neighborhood schools to make room for non-neighborhood charter students.
 
Each Attachment hereto includes the following, as mandated by Proposition 39 and the Regulations:
 
a)                     The process for staff’s determination that a particular charter school cannot be accommodated on a single site. The process included, among other things, (1) a description of how the District determined available classroom inventory to meet a charter school’s facilities request; (2) the rationale for making a multiple site offer; and (3) material considerations of student safety and welfare when balancing all available alternatives; and
 
b)                     A recommended finding that a certain charter school could not be accommodated at a single site and written statement of reasons explaining the finding, and a determination that it is necessary to move part of the charter school’s operations to an additional school site (if applicable).
 
Expected Outcomes:
As mandated by Proposition 39 and the Regulations, the Board will make findings and adopt written statements of the reasons why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) that submitted Proposition 39 facilities requests cannot be accommodated at a single school site for the 2025-2026 school year. The Board will also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If “no” vote, the District will not be in compliance with section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations requiring the Board to make findings and adopt written statements as to why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) will receive Proposition 39 preliminary proposals and/or final offers accommodating them at more than one school site.  The Board will also not determine if it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
If “yes” vote, the District will be in compliance with section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations requiring the Board to make findings and adopt written statements as to why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) will receive Proposition 39 preliminary proposals and/or final offers accommodating them at more than one school site.  The Board will also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
This finding has no budget impact.
 
Student Impact: 
Pursuant to Proposition 39, public school facilities should be shared fairly among all public-school pupils, including those in charter schools. Through this proposed action, the Board is adhering to this mandate.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Pursuant to Proposition 39 and the Regulations, the District is required to make a preliminary proposal and final offer of space to each charter school that submitted a legally sufficient request for facilities. If a charter school cannot be accommodated at a single school site, the Board must first make a finding that the charter school cannot be accommodated at a single site and adopt a written statement of the reasons explaining the finding.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Sol Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for KIPP Sol Academy  (“Charter School”), located in Board District 2 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy.
 
Background: 
KIPP Sol Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 461 students on a private facility at 4800 E. Cesar Chavez Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90022 in Board District 2 and Region East. KIPP Sol Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 485 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Sol Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Sol Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025.  
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code 47605 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.  
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Sol Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
                     
                     
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for KIPP Sol Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition, and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 157, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.   
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 2 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy. The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 550 students to 490 students.
 
Background: 
Los Angeles Leadership Academy is a 6-12 school currently serving 324 students on two private facilities at 234 E. Avenue 33, Los Angeles, CA, 90031 and 2670 Griffin Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90031 in Board District 2 and Region East.  Los Angeles Leadership Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 12, 2002.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 550 students in grades 6-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Los Angeles Leadership Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 16, 2024, Los Angeles Leadership Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 14, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current Los Angeles Leadership Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “High,” “Middle,” or “Low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Los Angeles Leadership Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined, that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 158, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

Approval of the Proposed Material Revision for Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High (“Charter School”), to add an additional site within the community, as defined in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools. The proposed site is located at 10025 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 618 students on a private facility at 10101 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA, 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 12, 2005.  On September 24, 2019, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 600 students in grades 9-12.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High’s complete material revision. Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2028.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA.  An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs.

If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Denial of the Proposed Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter Middle (“Charter School”), to relocate from the current Proposition 39 co-location at John A. Sutter Middle to a new private facility. The proposed facility is located at 6425 Kester Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91405 in Board District 3 and Region North. The recommendation for denial is based on information in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report and the Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle. 
 
Background: 
Ingenium Charter Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 180 students on the campus of John A. Sutter Middle School, as a co-location through Proposition 39 at 7330 Winnetka Ave, Winnetka, CA, 91306 in Board District 4 and Region North. Ingenium Charter Middle was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 12, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 270 students in grades 6-8.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Ingenium Charter Middle’s complete material revision. Ingenium Charter Middle seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2026.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has not met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends denial of the material revision of the charter.
 
Grounds for Denial
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the proposed material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter Middle and have assessed that the material revision does not meet the criteria for approval. As fully discussed in the attached Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle, based on review of the proposed material revision and Community Impact Assessment, staff has determined, in accordance with Education Code sections 47605(c)(2) and 47607 (a)(4) and (b), the following:
 
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the petition; and
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school under the terms of its current charter for the remainder of the charter term.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to approve the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, under the terms of its current charter. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the charter school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised material revision to the charter that meets the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605, all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State and District Required Language. Also, within the 30-day timeline, Charter School must execute any and all documents and/or take all necessary and appropriate actions to give full force and effect to the terms, provisions, and intent of its proposed material revision.
 
Policy Implications: 
There are no policy implications at this time.                     
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the material revision, the action will not have a budget impact. 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the material revision is approved, the impact on the budget could be the estimated revenue losses to the District schools based on the assumptions and the community fiscal impact analysis described below for Ingenium Charter Middle’s move to a proposed new facility outside of the community. Under the facts and circumstances described below, and as a factor leading to a denial recommendation, Ingenium Charter Middle’s application for a material revision is deemed to have a substantive fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed community.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution. 
 
Staff’s fiscal impact analysis is calculated based on multiple sourced assumptions (as reflected below) to provide a projection of Ingenium Charter Middle’s potential fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed target community.  
 
Based on Ingenium Charter Middle’s projected enrollment, 200 students in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, the charter school’s expected renewal year, the estimated total revenue loss for the District’s schools could be $2,439,638. Additionally, the aggregate fiscal impact on the District and charter schools in the proposed community could be $2,870,163 in Fiscal Year 2025-2026. Because District revenue is associated with average daily attendance (ADA) rather than enrollment (See 5 C.C.R § 402), the estimated District revenue loss is not directly proportionally associated with the number of students who would attend the charter school. Additionally, as a result of lower enrollment to the District schools, any loss of revenue may be offset by possible reductions in expenditures for the District’s services and programs.
Currently, there are five (5) other charter schools serving one or more similar grade levels (Grade 6-8) within the community of Ingenium Charter Middle’s proposed location.
 
Based on the above analysis, Charter School’s material revision request, if approved by the LAUSD Board, could substantively impact (fiscally) existing District schools in the proposed target community.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:

Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter (“Charter School”), to relocate from current Proposition 39 location (Canoga Park Middle) to a new private facility outside the community. The proposed facility is located at 6425 Kester Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91405 in Board District 3 and Region North. The recommendation for denial is based on information in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report and the Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter.
 
Background: 
Ingenium Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 298 students on the campus of Canoga Park Middle, as a co-location through Proposition 39 at 22250 Elkwood Street, Canoga Park, CA, 91304 in Board District 3 and Region North. Ingenium Charter was approved by the California State Board of Education on January 5, 2010, after denial by LAUSD Board of Education. On November 19, 2019, the charter school was renewed by LAUSD for another five-year term to serve up to 611 students in grades TK-5.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Ingenium Charter’s complete material revision. Ingenium Charter seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2028.

Staff’s fiscal impact analysis is calculated based on multiple sourced assumptions (as reflected below) to provide a projection of Ingenium Charter’s potential fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed target community.  
 
Based on Ingenium Charter’s projected enrollment (250 students in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, increasing to 350 students by Charter School’s expected renewal year (i.e., Fiscal Year 2027-2028)), the estimated total revenue loss for the District’s schools could be $4,350,906 in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, increasing to $6,091,268 by Charter School’s renewal year and amounting to $15,663,261 over the period of Ingenium Charter’s remaining charter term. Additionally, the aggregate fiscal impact on the District and charter schools in the proposed community could be $17,025,283 over the period of Ingenium Charter’s remaining charter term. Because District revenue is associated with average daily attendance (ADA) rather than enrollment (See 5 C.C.R § 402), the estimated District revenue loss is not directly proportionally associated with the number of students who would attend the charter school. Additionally, as a result of lower enrollment to the District schools, any loss of revenue may be offset by possible reductions in expenditures for the District’s services and programs.
 
Currently, there are four (4) other charter schools serving one or more similar grade levels (Grade TK-5) within the community of Ingenium Charter’s proposed location.
 
Based on the above analysis, Charter School’s material revision request, if approved by the LAUSD Board, could substantively impact (fiscally) existing District schools in the proposed target community.

Approval of the Proposed Material Revision for Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4 (“Charter School”), to add an additional site within the community, as defined in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools. The proposed additional site is located at 9701 S. Main Street, Los Angeles, CA 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4 is a 6-8 school currently serving 488 students on a private facility at 9719 S. Main Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4 was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 14, 2009. On September 25, 2018, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 450 students in grades 6-8.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4’s complete material revision. Alliance College-Ready Middle Academy 4 seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2027.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
                     
Budget Impact:
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of the Proposed Material Revision for Alliance Gertz-Ressler Richard Merkin 6-12 Complex
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for Alliance Gertz-Ressler Richard Merkin 6-12 Complex (“Charter School”), to add an additional site within the community, as defined in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools. The proposed additional site is located at 2211 S. Union Street, Los Angeles, CA 90007 in Board District 5 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
Alliance Gertz-Ressler Richard Merkin 6-12 Complex is a 6-12 span school currently serving 1,035 students on a private facility at 2023 S. Union Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 5 and Region South. Alliance Gertz-Ressler Richard Merkin 6-12 Complex was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 27, 2004.  On September 25, 2018, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 1,010 students in grades 6-12.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Alliance Gertz-Merkin’s complete material revision. Alliance Gertz-Ressler Richard Merkin 6-12 Complex seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2027.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Crete Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for Crete Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 1 and Region South, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy.  The school’s renewal petition includes a reduction in enrollment capacity from 363 to 355.
 
Background: 
Crete Academy is a TK-6 school currently serving 283 students on two private facilities at 6103 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043, and 1729 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90062 in Board District 1 and Region South. Crete Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Crete Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, Crete Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Crete Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
•                     Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Crete Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined, Charter School shall not renew as a Low performing charter school based on performance indicators and pursuant to the statutory renewal framework. (Ed. Code § 47607.2(a).) Additionally, Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Ed. Code § 47605(c)(2).) 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the Board.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025.  The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition, consistently with the Board’s action and direction, for a two (2) year period beginning July 1, 2025.  Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written factual findings for the approval of Charter School’s renewal petition consistent with Education Code section 47607.2(a)(4).
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 1. The District shall retain all state and federal special education funding allocated to the SELPA for Charter School students. The District shall be responsible for providing all appropriate special education and related services in accordance with applicable state and federal laws for Charter School students as set forth in the applicable MOU. The parties understand and agree that Charter School has an equitable financial contribution obligation under section 47646 of the Education Code. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education is 25% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period which is paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each fiscal year until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. For the remainder of Charter School’s petition period, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval, and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

description
Whereas, Los Angeles is experiencing a housing crisis, and skyrocketing rents and home prices are leading to higher costs of living and increasing levels of homelessness. The Affordable Housing Outcomes Report presented to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in September 2023, found that the County lacks over 500,000 affordable homes to meet the current demand among renter households at or below 50 percent of the area median income;
 
Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District (District) employees commute long distances to serve our students while seeking reasonably priced rentals and homes outside District boundaries; 
 
Whereas, The District operates 1,200 schools and centers and owns 21,000 buildings-more than 78 million square feet-and 6,400 acres or 10 square miles of land; 
 
Whereas, The District has underutilized assets including closed schools or other facilities, former agricultural land, and portions of school sites with excess storage;
 
Whereas, Joint occupancy and other legal vehicles allow the District to enter into public-private partnerships to leverage underutilized assets for the purpose of providing value to the District;
 
Whereas, Starting in 2015, the District has utilized specific District-owned properties to provide 185 units of affordable family housing-with preference given to District staff and employees-at Sage Park in Gardena, Selma Community Housing in Hollywood, and Norwood Learning Village in Los Angeles; 
 
Whereas, Currently, over 7,000 District employees are on the waitlist for housing at the three existing projects;
 
Whereas, Providing employee housing will help make the District an employer of choice by helping attract and retain qualified teachers and staff, reducing commute times to and from work which has a positive impact on the environment, and alleviating the regional housing shortage; 
 
Whereas, In September 2016, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously passed “Exploring Options to Develop Workforce Housing in Sun Valley for Employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District” which directed the Superintendent to study the development of additional workforce housing;
 
Whereas, In March 2017, the Facilities and Audit Committee received a presentation entitled, “Using Underutilized Assets to Address District Goals and Priorities;” 
Whereas, In November 2018, the Board passed “Increasing Opportunities and Supports for Our Homeless Students and Families” in order to support students and families experiencing homelessness;
 
Whereas, In June 2020, The Superintendent presented a Real Estate Evaluation detailing the 21,000 District owned buildings across 6,400 acres of land. The goal was to develop 2,000 units of housing for LA Unified employees, including teachers;
 
Whereas, In November 2020, the Superintendent recommended that the Board approve the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFPs) seeking proposals for the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of three District properties and consider proposals for employee housing at 10 vacant District properties; 
 
Whereas, In June 2021, the District launched a new effort to provide affordable housing which would allow District teachers, staff and families to live in the communities they serve. The Board authorized $1.5 million from the General Fund to conduct due diligence activities for the purpose of identifying options to provide affordable employee housing;
 
Whereas, In Fall 2023, the District released a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) for the development and financing of housing for District employees and families. It garnered responses from development firms and financial institutions willing to support the District's housing initiative. The below preliminary sites identified in the REI included nine District owned sites that were vacant and/or underutilized and not part of a school:
 
•                     Paved parking lot located at 4523 Exposition Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90016;
•                     Vacant parcel adjacent to Vista Hermosa Park;
•                     Vacant lot located at the intersection of Shoup Ave. and Collins St.;
•                     Multiple portable buildings and parking lot located at 1049 N. Fairfax Ave. West Hollywood, CA 90046;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 2726 Francis Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90005;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 644 E 56th St. Los Angeles, CA 90011;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 234 E 112th St. Los Angeles, CA 90061;
•                     Vacant 3-story medical building, surface parking, and storage building located at 10339 Balboa Blvd. Granada Hills, CA 91344; and
•                     Vacant unimproved lot located at 4315 New York Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90022
 
Whereas, In November 2023, a Community Briefing was held to discuss the District’s initiative regarding affordable housing and preview the survey to assess housing heeds;
 
Whereas, In May 2024, the District surveyed employees and families to gauge interest in a range of housing options. Data from the survey is meant to support the District's efforts to potentially repurpose underutilized real estate assets to provide housing that is more affordable for employees and families; 
 
Whereas, In October 2024, the Facilities and Procurement committee heard an update on the District's Housing Initiative; and
 
Whereas, Despite the extensive timeline and current demand for housing, the District has not yet released RFPs for workforce housing for over a decade and can’t say with certainty when they will be released; now, therefore be it 
 
Resolved, At the Committee of the Whole meeting on January 28, 2025, the Los Angeles Unified School District shall present to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the public the following:
 
•                     Data collected from the Housing Survey and appropriate analysis; 
•                     Plan to solicit proposals by June 1, 2025, for the nine vacant and/or underutilized sites identified in the REI to create additional affordable workforce housing units;
•                     Timeline of key dates and activities from now through the proposed completion of the aforementioned units; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall provide quarterly reports to the Board outlining progress towards the development of employee housing units until they are completed.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to community-centered greening initiatives that advance sustainability, climate resilience, and equity as demonstrated by previous resolutions, including: Transitioning LAUSD to 100% Clean, Renewable, Energy Resulting in Healthier Students and More Sustainable, Equitable, Communities (Res 018-19/20 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Board%20Resolution%20-%20100%20Percent%20Clean%20Energy%20-%202020.pdf>); Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses (Res 002-22/23 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Green-Schoolyards-For-All-Resolution.pdf>); and Climate Literacy (Res-016-21/22 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/ClimateLiteracy016-2022.pdf>);
 
Whereas, In alignment with the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkhmuidtUO1DkBVn_gUGMY68IzFCuJGX/view>, Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District prioritizes strong partnerships and inclusive engagement with community organizations, parents and students in greening efforts;
 
Whereas, The Eco-Sustainability Office (ESO) is committed to supporting the District Strategic Plan by developing and implementing programs and policies that raise awareness of environmental stewardship and provide healthy, sustainable learning environments for all LAUSD students. Among its many responsibilities, this office plays a substantial role in developing and maintaining partnerships with non-profit organizations, labor unions, businesses, government agencies, and school communities;
 
Whereas, Non-profit organizations have partnered with LAUSD for decades to promote school greening, sustainability and climate resilience. The 2024 Green Schoolyards for All Plan outlines greening projects funded by state grants including 10 projects in planning/design, 2 projects under construction, and 10 projects under feasibility studies. Over the last five years, non-profit organizations have secured over $57 million to plant trees and transform 52 schoolyards throughout the District. Also, through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL FIRE) non-profit organizations will partner with the District to implement 41 greening projects, expanding tree coverage, shade and learning opportunities;
 
Whereas, Despite their contributions, non-profit organizations leading grant-funded greening projects must cover various internal fees and services such as Owner’s Authorized Representative fees, testing requirements, design reviews, and inspections. These expenses can constitute 10-20% of the total planning and construction costs of a project. For instance, seven non-profits that have secured $34 million in grant awards for the District are being charged $3 million in fees by the District;
 
Whereas, The ESO is exploring funding solutions to address financial gaps arising after grants are awarded and is developing an updated “how-to” guide to streamline third-party greening project processes; and
 
Whereas, The ESO and Facilities Services Division (FSD) have collaborated to: (1) streamline project supervision requirements for greening projects and reduce oversight expenses; (2) develop recommendations for Design Guidelines that are tailored to school greening, and (3) consider modifications to Development Agreement language to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) expresses its sincere gratitude to all community partners, parents, and students for their dedication to fostering equitable, sustainable, and thriving learning environments, and commits to accelerating efforts to strengthen these vital relationships;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent, in collaboration with the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to invest in and strengthen external partnerships to advance greening initiatives by mitigating costs for partners through District resources, including but not limited to eligible bond funds. This includes costs associated with ADA retrofits, District staff time, project fees, and testing requirements, thereby incentivizing collaboration and maximizing the impact of greening projects. Furthermore, the Superintendent shall ensure that staffing time dedicated to these initiatives reflects the scale and complexity of each project, with a focus on streamlining processes and promoting equitable access to greening projects in underserved and marginalized communities;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall strengthen community engagement in greening initiatives prioritizing the leadership of Black and brown communities, by (1) expanding the Office of Eco-Sustainability to include culturally reflective and regional support systems, and (2) creating more opportunities for parent-led collaboration in school-based greening and climate resilience efforts;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall conduct a Green Jobs Pathways Study centered on Black and brown communities to augment partnerships with local businesses, trade unions, and educational institutions, mapping pathways into the green economy for students and families with an emphasis on creating and incentivizing opportunities that lead to high-paying careers. The study will identify emerging green sectors, such as renewable energy and sustainable construction, among others, and align existing District programs to enhance career readiness by expanding pilot initiatives and partnerships that provide internships, apprenticeships, and certifications; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Superintendent shall present to the Board within 90 days a comprehensive plan outlining the steps, timelines, and responsible parties for implementing the directives in this resolution, including clear, measurable benchmarks and goals to assess progress.
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) recognizes the vital role of non-profit organizations in creating sustainable and equitable learning environments for all students, and commits to strengthening and expanding partnerships within this sector;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to remove internal fees for non-profit organizations that lead District school greening projects regardless of funding source. Where feasible, up to $3 million in District resources, including eligible bond funds, will be allocated to cover costs such as: Owner’s Authorized Representative fees; project fees; ADA retrofits; District staff time; testing; design reviews; and inspections;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to develop an implementation plan defining eligibility criterion for non-profit organizations and projects. The plan will describe strategies to remove and/or mitigate fees, such as fee waivers, returning or reimbursing costs for fees that non-profit organizations have already paid, reclassifying internal fees as in-kind contributions, and precluding the upfront payment of fees; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to present to the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee a comprehensive plan for fee removal and a progress report on potential funding options to support third-party greening projects, within 120 days. The District will also provide a progress report on (1) the District’s “how-to” guide for greening projects requirements; (2) recommendations to streamline project supervision requirements and reduce oversight expenses; (3) development of school greening-specific Design Guidelines; and (4) potential modification to Development Agreements to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners.",,,,,,,,

Request for Approval of 2025 Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities
January 14, 2025
Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approval to sponsor legislation and proactively advocate for policies and funding proposals at the local, state and federal levels that are consistent with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Background: 
Each year the Office of Government Relations (OGR) presents to the Board proposed advocacy priorities for the upcoming year. This includes securing authors for legislation, advocating for changes/inclusion in budget and funding proposals, and taking positions on related bills, regulatory changes, and policy issues as presented on the attached documents. Given the unprecedented challenges the District has faced in recent years and the uncertainty that lies ahead, it will be important to build in flexibility to authorize the Office of Governmental Relations to pursue the necessary advocacy on other policy and funding priorities as new issues arise in 2025.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approved policy and funding priorities will result in a coherent advocacy agenda that the Office of Governmental Relations will promote and advance by building local and state coalitions with a diverse set of education partners.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval will allow OGR staff to proceed in a timely manner to secure authors for legislation and pursue advocacy with the various levels of government.  Delay in approval will negatively impact the securing of authors for legislation prior to the legislative deadlines for the introduction of bills.
 
Policy Implications: 
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support existing Board policies and are in alignment with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Budget Impact: 
Costs of the proposal are borne by OGR within the existing general fund budget.
 
Student Impact: 
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support students and their academic achievement either directly or indirectly through legislation and policies.  Advocacy on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified community is critical to the success of students, teachers and administrators, and the advancement of our schools.

Request for Board Authority to Pursue a Two-Year Extension to the Waiver of a Portion of Education Code 45272(a) [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Personnel Commission & Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Office of Governmental Relations, in coordination with the Personnel Commission, to seek a two-year extension to the previously authorized waiver of a portion of Education Code 45272 (a), so that hiring appointments may be made by schools from other than the first three ranks of eligible applicants on the eligibility list for certain classified school-based entry level positions. The current two-year waiver will expire on June 30, 2025.
 
Background: 
At the Board’s December 7, 2021, meeting, the Board approved the Office of Government Relations (OGR) staff to seek a two-year waiver of a portion of Education Code 45272 (a) to the State Board of Education (SBE). 
 
Education Code 45272(a) reads:
(a) All vacancies in the classified service shall be filled pursuant to this article and the rules of the commission, from applicants on eligibility lists which, wherever practicable, as determined by the commission, shall be made up from promotional examinations, or appointments may be made by means of transfer, demotion, reinstatement, and reemployment in accordance with the rules of the commission. All applicants for promotional examinations shall have the required amount of service in classes designated by the commission or meet the minimum qualifications of education, training, experience, and length of service, which shall be determined by the commission to be appropriate for the class for which they have applied…Appointments shall be made from the eligibles having the first three ranks on the list who are ready and willing to accept the position.
 
OGR staff submitted for and obtained a waiver for the classifications of Building and Grounds Worker, Food Service Worker, and Special Education Trainee/Assistant. The SBE granted the waiver for only one year since this was a new request and recommended that the effectiveness of the waiver be studied. The conditions of the waiver also allowed Los Angeles Unified to submit for an extension if the waiver helped to increase the hiring rate of the selected classifications. 
 
On April 18, 2023, the Board approved a request from OGR staff to seek an extension to the waiver, and to add two new positions, Office Technician and Library Aide, to the positions that were eligible for the waiver. This waiver was granted, and is effective from July 3, 2023, to June 30, 2025. Staff recommends seeking an additional extension to this waiver for the five positions that currently benefit from that flexibility. The circumstances that necessitated a waiver have not changed, as described below. Additionally, expanded district programs will require expeditious hiring of Outdoor Education Assistants to serve our students. As such, we are recommending the waiver include this additional classification. 
The process entailed in Education Code 45272(a) requires that offers of employment be made to the top three candidates on any such eligibility list before any other candidates on the list can be made offers of employment. The process of doing so results in numerous vacancies waiting to be filled at various school sites if the top three ranks of candidates are not available or have interviewed at other schools and accepted offers. 
 
The waiver has allowed certain school-based, entry level positions to be filled simultaneously at various schools throughout the District. This flexibility has resulted in increased rates of hiring, as demonstrated by the chart below:

As required by the SBE waiver process, the Parent Advisory Committee and affected labor groups were consulted regarding this waiver request.
 
Expected Outcomes:
That the granting of a two-year extension to the waiver will result in faster job offers to fill vacancies at schools for more candidates. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may approve the proposal, and the Office of Governmental Relations will proceed to seek the extension to the waiver from the SBE, as stated. The Board may elect not to approve the proposal and the rate of filling vacancies at schools will return to being governed by three-ranks rule effective July 1, 2025, which will delay the hiring of qualified candidates for entry-level positions at school sites.
 
Policy Implications: 
If granted, the extended waiver will modify the way in which hiring for entry-level classified candidates at school sites are prioritized, based on the candidates’ position on the eligibility list. All candidates on the eligibility list will be eligible for hire immediately.
 
Budget Impact: 
Not Applicable
Student Impact: 
Filling school-based vacancies faster positively impacts students as incumbents in these positions provide direct services for students, and staff is relieved of the burden of performing tasks outside of their job classification during a prolonged hiring process. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If an extended waiver is granted, the use of the waiver would be limited to entry-level positions for which an external recruitment is utilized to fill many vacancies. The rule of three ranks would still be followed for positions in non-school offices.

Adoption of Authorization to Execute Certain Contracts Without Advertising or Inviting Bids to Respond Effectively to the January 2025 Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions; Resolution Declaring Emergency Conditions Exist at Los Angeles Unified Schools and Offices
January 14, 2025
Office of the Superintendent
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Staff proposes that the Board of Education (“Board”) take the following actions related to the emergency conditions related to the life-threatening, destructive, widespread severe windstorm and resulting significant high risk and dangerous fire weather conditions, including active fires in and around the Pacific Palisades and Altadena/Pasadena areas (the “Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions”) being experienced by the District.
 
1.                     Adopt a Resolution, attached hereto, declaring that emergency conditions, both structural and health related, exist throughout multiple District schools and offices (collectively known as “District Sites”) as a result of the Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions.
 
2.                     Authorize, by unanimous vote, under the provisions of section 20113 of the California Public Contract Code, the Superintendent and/or his designee(s) to enter into any and all contracts necessary for the procurement of materials and services necessary for the District to address the emergency conditions (health, safety, and property) caused directly or indirectly by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions as well as property damage mitigation measures (“Emergency Contracts”), without advertising or inviting bids, and for any dollar amount necessary to respond to the emergency conditions at District sites; and, notwithstanding section 20114, authorize the use of day labor or force account labor for the purpose. This delegation will expire on June 30, 2025, unless otherwise rescinded or extended by the Board of Education. Any Emergency Contracts issued shall be presented to the Board for ratification; and monthly updates shall be provided if contracts are issued.
 
3.                     Authorize the Superintendent and/or his designee to take any and all actions necessary to address the emergency conditions including giving effect to the Emergency Contracts to help ensure the continuation of public education, the health and safety of District students and staff, and the repair and restoration of District property in response to the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions. 
Background:
Beginning on January 7, 2025, major wildfires, fueled by hurricane force winds, rapidly spread throughout significant portions of Los Angeles Unified. Massive devastation resulted in the impacted communities, and continues to occur in communities, homes, and schools causing Governor Gavin Newsom to proclaim a state of emergency. Fires continue to rage throughout communities containing District Sites, causing major air quality hazards, property damage, evacuation orders, the closure of District schools and offices, and strain on resources available to the District’s students and staff. 
 
 
This Resolution will give the Superintendent and/or his designee(s) the ability to procure materials, resources, and services, in an expeditious manner, to address damage that has already occurred, mitigate further property damage, ensure student and staff safety, provide resources to communities within the District’s boundaries, and facilitate efforts to return students to effective and safe learning environments. 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the attached Resolution declaring that emergency conditions exist at District Sites and within the communities served by the District Sites. It is further anticipated that the Board of Education will authorize the Superintendent to take any and all actions necessary to procure and enter into Emergency Contracts to ensure the health and safety of students, staff, and community, and return the continuity of public education, mitigate and/or address any damage to District Sites caused by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions. Moreover, it is anticipated that the Board will authorize the use of day labor and force account labor that may exceed the hourly and cost of materials limitations set forth in section 20114.  
Board Options and Consequences:
If the Board of Education does not approve the proposed actions contained in this Board Report, staff will be unable to take immediate and necessary procurement actions to protect the health and safety of students, staff, and District Sites, and to ensure the delivery of in-person instruction. Any such contracts necessary to address the significant challenges posed by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions over the existing delegated authority, would need to go through a bid process and Board approval. 
Policy Implications:
The proposed actions are consistent with Rules 1757 and 1758 of the Rules of the Board of Education. 
Budget Impact:
There will be an impact to the budget. At this time, the amount is unknown and unpredictable.
 
Student Impact:
This helps to protect student health and safety while ensuring the continuity of instruction in an educational environment that will help students achieve their educational goals.
 
Equity Impact:
None.
 
Issues and Analysis:
See attached Resolution.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Crete Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for Crete Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 1 and Region South, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy.  The school’s renewal petition includes a reduction in enrollment capacity from 363 to 355.
 
Background: 
Crete Academy is a TK-6 school currently serving 283 students on two private facilities at 6103 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043, and 1729 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90062 in Board District 1 and Region South. Crete Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Crete Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, Crete Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Crete Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
•                     Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Crete Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined, Charter School shall not renew as a Low performing charter school based on performance indicators and pursuant to the statutory renewal framework. (Ed. Code § 47607.2(a).) Additionally, Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Ed. Code § 47605(c)(2).) 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the Board.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025.  The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition, consistently with the Board’s action and direction, for a two (2) year period beginning July 1, 2025.  Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written factual findings for the approval of Charter School’s renewal petition consistent with Education Code section 47607.2(a)(4).
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 1. The District shall retain all state and federal special education funding allocated to the SELPA for Charter School students. The District shall be responsible for providing all appropriate special education and related services in accordance with applicable state and federal laws for Charter School students as set forth in the applicable MOU. The parties understand and agree that Charter School has an equitable financial contribution obligation under section 47646 of the Education Code. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education is 25% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period which is paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each fiscal year until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. For the remainder of Charter School’s petition period, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval, and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle. The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 240 to 180 students. 
 
Background: 
Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle is a 5-8 school currently serving 86 students on a private facility at 15355 Morrison Street, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91403 in Board District 3 and Region North. Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2007.  On January 10, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 240 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 16, 2024, Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 14, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

Current Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;

(Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 153, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition     
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

Approval of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Corazón Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Corazón Academy (“Charter School”), with benchmarks in the areas of academics, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve 1042 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Charter School’s currently authorized enrollment capacity is 1,042. As part of Charter School’s renewal petition submission, Charter School included an increase of 100 students from 1,042 to 1,142. At the same time as the renewal petition submission, Charter School submitted its material revision application seeking to increase its enrollment capacity from 1,142 to 1,205 students and add a location. However, pursuant to the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, Charter School’s material revision application did not contain the information and/or documents necessary to begin processing. As such, Staff cannot process Charter School’s material revision application at this time. Staff has communicated to Charter School that the District will consider its material revision request when appropriately submitted. Staff recommends the renewal of Charter School’s petition with the currently authorized enrollment capacity of 1,042. 
 
Background: 
KIPP Corazón Academy is a TK-8 school currently serving 1055 students on two private facilities at 9325 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, and 8616 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, in Board District 5 and Region East. KIPP Corazón Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Corazón Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Corazón Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Corazón Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 154, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of Procurement Actions
January 14, 2025
Procurement Services Division 
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of  award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed in Attachment “B.”
 
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts.
 
 
Student Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See attached for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form.

Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions
January 14, 2025
Procurement Services Division - Facilities Contracts
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services/amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approve the proposed contract listed in Attachment B including a Major Modernization Project contract at Fairfax High School.
 
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013, Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
 
 
 
Student Impact: 
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.
 
Attachments:
Attachment “A” - Ratification of Facilities Contracts Actions Awarded Under Delegated Authority
Attachment “B” - Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions Not Under Delegated Authority

Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report, Adoption of the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School Major Modernization Project
January 14, 2025
Office of Environmental Health & Safety
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Review and certify the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the proposed Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School Major Modernization Project (Project) prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) and State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 §15000 et seq.).
 
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning and feasibility activities necessary to propose scope recommendations, budget and schedule for the proposed Project (Board Report No. 085-21/22). Subsequently, on November 15, 2022, the Board approved the project redefinition for the proposed Project to begin the environmental review, design, procurement and other activities necessary to implement the proposed Project (Board Report No. 074-22/23). 
 
The proposed Project is located within the 11.18-acre school campus at 3010 Estara Avenue within the Glassell Park/Los Feliz neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles (Board District 5, Region West). Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School (School) opened in 1937. All existing buildings were constructed between 1937 and 2004.  The campus has been identified eligible as a historic district due to its depiction of a post-Long Beach Earthquake middle school campus that embodies Los Angeles Unified school planning and design concepts of the period and is an example of PWA (Public Works Administration) Moderne architecture applied to a middle school campus. The Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building, Homemaking Building and five relocatable buildings are identified as being located on an earthquake fault. As of the 2023-2024 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the School served approximately 800 students in grades 6 through 8 and the projected enrollment for planning purposes is 750 students.
 
The proposed Project will construct new facilities, including a two-story Classroom Building with 19 general and specialty classrooms and support spaces, library, student store and administration spaces; a one-story Maintenance & Operations Building with office and support spaces; and a one-story City of Angels Building with 2 general classrooms and support spaces. The proposed Project also includes the seismic retrofit of the existing Auditorium and infrastructure upgrades to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The proposed Project will reduce the School’s current capacity and total number of classrooms from 65 to 46 classrooms based on the planned/projected enrollment.
 
 
 
The proposed Project includes the demolition of three permanent buildings (two-story Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building and one-story Homemaking Building) and six relocatable buildings. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impact during construction. 
 
The proposed Project also includes utility upgrades; a campus-wide fire alarm upgrade; Internet Protocol (IP) convergence; new parking areas; new outdoor learning environments; the removal and replacement of trees; landscaping and irrigation; hardscaping; fencing, gates and site furnishings. 
 
The Campus is not on any hazardous waste site lists under Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. A Preliminary Environmental Assessment-Equivalent (PEA-E) was conducted for the proposed Project in accordance with the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) guidelines. A Soil Removal Plan (SRP) would be implemented as part of the proposed Project to address the removal of contaminated soil. Similar reports would be prepared to address suspect asphalt and building materials encountered during construction. There is no direct student or staff exposure to the impacted soils since the affected soils are under asphalt pavement or will be off-limits. The SRP would ensure students and staff are not exposed to impacted soils during the removal work.   
 
The District’s Office of Environmental Health & Safety (OEHS) evaluated the proposed Project to determine its potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA, Public Resources Code §21000, et seq., and State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations §15000 et seq. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study, resulted in the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (State Clearinghouse Number 2023120006). The Draft EIR focused on seven environmental areas: air quality; cultural resources; greenhouse gas emissions; hazards and hazardous materials; noise and pedestrian safety and transportation and traffic. The analysis documented in the Draft EIR found that the proposed Project would result in significant and unavoidable impacts to cultural resources. A Statement of Overriding Considerations by the Board for this impact will therefore be required. 
 
The Draft EIR also evaluated two alternatives to the proposed Project: (1) No Project/No Development and (2) Retain Entire Administration Building (the Administration Building would remain as-is while other components of the project would proceed). Other alternatives that would rehabilitate or retain a portion of the Administration Building were determined to be infeasible and not further evaluated in the EIR. Both alternatives would result in fewer environmental impacts compared to the proposed Project. However, neither of them meet most of the District’s objectives for the School Upgrade Program or the Project-specific objectives for the proposed Project. 
 
The Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period from September 16, 2024 through October 31, 2024. Copies of the Draft EIR, PEA-E and SRP were available for review electronically on the OEHS website and on the State Clearinghouse website. Printed copies were also made available for public review at OEHS District Headquarters at Beaudry and at Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School.
 
The Notice of Availability of Draft EIR (Notice of Availability or NOA) was posted on the OEHS website during the public review period, mailed the NOA to all owner/occupants located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Project site, to parents/guardians of students and published the NOI in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The NOA was filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk and with the State Clearinghouse for distribution to potentially affected state agencies, and the District mailed copies of the NOA directly to potentially affected state agencies, local agencies, tribal agencies pursuant to AB 52 and known interested parties. 
 
During the public review period, a community meeting was held on October 17, 2024, to provide information about the Project and receive comments on the Draft EIR. The community meeting was advertised along with the NOA through direct mailing to occupants within 0.25-mile of the Project site, door-to-door distribution of event flyers and in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The meeting included an overview of the proposed Project and the contents and findings of the Draft EIR and gave faculty, staff, agencies, organizations, parents/guardians and community members the opportunity to make verbal and written comments on the Project and the Draft EIR.
 
At the end of the public review period, the District received three comment letters from members of the community and verbal comments from individuals during the community meeting. All letters and verbal comments were responded to by the District and are included in the Final EIR, which was circulated for a 10-day agency review period beginning on December 16, 2024. 
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053 and the Board shall review and consider the attached Resolution which certifies the Final EIR and adopts the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations for the proposed Project.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will review and make a determination on the attached Resolution to certify the Final EIR, adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations, pursuant to CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This action is required for the Board to consider approving the proposed Project.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “yes” vote to certify the Final EIR and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations would enable the LAUSD to proceed with the proposed Project as proposed in the Final EIR.  A vote of “no” to certify the Final EIR and adopt the Findings of Fact, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations would prevent the Board from approving the proposed Project and the proposed Project could not proceed into design and construction.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project, once completed, will help ensure that the students attending the school are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.
 
 
 
 
 
Equity Impact:
The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified’s reliance on relocatable buildings and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows the District to reach more schools with the limited funding available.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Environmental review of the proposed Project found that, with the incorporation of District Standards and Specifications, mitigation measures, as well as all applicable state, federal and local regulations, there would be significant impacts related to cultural resources as a result of the proposed Project. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study and Draft EIR, resulted in the preparation of the Final EIR, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations. 
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in the State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053, and the Board shall review and consider the MND, MMRP and its supporting documents and comments.

Project Approval for the Washington Irving Middle School Math Music Engineering Magnet Major Modernization Project
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the proposed Washington Irving Middle School Math Music Engineering Magnet Major Modernization Project (Project). 
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments to implement the proposed Project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety’s (OEHS) evaluation of the proposed Project resulted in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, staff is requesting the Board of Education (Board) approve the proposed Project so that construction activities can commence at a later date. The proposed action may only be considered after the Board certifies the EIR prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project.     
 
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary to propose scope recommendations, budget, and schedule for the proposed Project. Subsequently, on November 15, 2022, the Board approved the project redefinition for the proposed Project to begin the environmental review, design, procurement, and other activities necessary to implement the proposed Project. 
 
The proposed Project is located within the 11.18-acre school campus at 3010 Estara Avenue within the Glassell Park/Los Feliz neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles (Board District 5, Region West). Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School (School) opened in 1937. All existing buildings were constructed between 1937 and 2004.  The campus has been identified eligible as a historic district due to its depiction of a post-Long Beach Earthquake middle school campus that embodies Los Angeles Unified school planning and design concepts of the period and is an example of PWA (Public Works Administration) Moderne architecture applied to a middle school campus. The Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building, Homemaking Building and five relocatable buildings are identified as being located on an earthquake fault. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the School served approximately 900 students in grades 6 through 8 and the projected enrollment for planning purposes is 750 students.
 
The proposed Project will construct new facilities, including a two-story Classroom Building with 19 general and specialty classrooms and support spaces, library, student store and administration spaces; a one-story Maintenance & Operations Building with office and support spaces; and a one-story City of Angels Building with 2 general classrooms and support spaces. The proposed Project also includes the seismic retrofit of the existing Auditorium and infrastructure upgrades to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The proposed Project will reduce the School’s current capacity and total number of classrooms from 65 to 46 classrooms based on the planned/projected enrollment.
 
The proposed Project includes the demolition of three permanent buildings (two-story Administration Building, one-story Classroom Building and one-story Homemaking Building), and six relocatable buildings. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impact during construction. 
 
The proposed Project also includes utility upgrades; a campus-wide fire alarm upgrade; Internet Protocol (IP) convergence; new parking areas; new outdoor learning environments; the removal and replacement of trees; landscaping and irrigation; hardscaping; fencing, gates, and site furnishings. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the proposed Project will permit construction activities to be undertaken once the Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval is secured. Construction activities related to the construction of new buildings are anticipated to begin in the third quarter of 2026, and site/utility/interim facilities activities may begin in advance of this work, in an earlier phase. Construction is anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2030.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of staff’s proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured. If the proposed action is not adopted, staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities. As a result, the School will continue to operate with aging, deteriorating, and outdated buildings and grounds and will continue to have students in buildings located on an earthquake fault. Furthermore, students, staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.
 
Budget Impact: 
The proposed action does not have a budget impact as the Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it adopted the project definition. The current budget for the proposed Project is $173,355,078. The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.  
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will help ensure that approximately 900 existing and future students attending the school are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.
 
Equity Impact:
The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified’s reliance on relocatable buildings, and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the proposed Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows Los Angeles Unified to reach more schools with the limited funding available.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of an EIR. The EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period from September 16, 2024, to October 31, 2024. The analysis documented in the EIR found that the proposed Project would result in significant environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction, the Board must certify the EIR and subsequently must approve the proposed Project.

Define and Approve Seven Playground and Campus Exterior Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve seven Playground and Campus Exterior Upgrade Projects (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $93,047,853.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework and approved the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) to help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. The Implementation Plan included, among other things, the development of playground and campus exterior upgrade projects within the category of need for Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components. These proposed Projects will address the most deteriorated paving conditions and transform playground areas.
 
The proposed Projects include, but are not limited to, greening and landscaping improvements throughout the campus to meet the District’s goal of schoolyards to be 30% green/natural, paving replacement in playgrounds and other areas, solar reflective coating in playgrounds, privacy fencing where needed, exterior painting of all buildings and structures, and accessibility upgrades, as described in Exhibit A.
 
Additionally, the proposed project at Dolores Street Elementary School (Dolores) will incorporate Bond Program funds earmarked in the Implementation Plan for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan Implementation. On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan (Transition Plan) under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan identified program accessibility upgrades as a priority at Dolores and these have been incorporated into the Project as described in Exhibit A.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024. Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the BOC and the Board of Education (Board), the District provided the BOC with the opportunity to consider the bond funded proposal and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to approve or disapprove the proposal, prior to presenting the item to the Board for final action. Following discussion, a vote was taken which resulted in 5 ayes, 4 nays, 1 abstention, and 3 absences, as referenced in Exhibit B. Having fulfilled the requirements under the MOU, and after further review with staff, the proposal will proceed to the Board without a BOC recommendation. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt this proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the seven proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, and RR. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and playground and campus exterior upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing playground and campus exterior upgrades at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined budget for the seven proposed Projects is $93,047,853. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
The $27,861,742 budget for the proposed Project at Dolores includes $8,215,000 for accessibility upgrades. Bond Program funds targeted for the ADA Transition Plan Implementation will be transferred to funds earmarked in the SUP for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed Project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure more than 3,000 current and future students attending the seven schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities Condition Assessment data identified schools with the worst paving condition based on age, aesthetics, deterioration, health and safety concerns, and weighting factors for paving condition and the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index was applied to achieve an equitable distribution to prioritize schools across the District for development of a proposed Project.
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Define and Approve Two Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein 
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve two projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed projects is $6,366,108.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes a project to provide roofing replacement at Thomas A. Edison Middle School and a project to provide stormwater system replacement at Verdugo Hills High School. 
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve two projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the two proposed projects is $6,366,108 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 2,000 current and future students attending these two schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Authorization to Finalize Negotiations and Execute a Renewal License Agreement for Use of Radio Tower Space at Palos Verdes 1, Rancho Palos Verdes CA
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s), to execute a renewal license agreement (Agreement), and/or any other reasonable instruments, with American Tower Asset Sub, LLC, for an existing remote tower space located at 3690 East Crest Road in Rancho Palos Verdes. The tower provides radiofrequency transmission used for the radio communication system which is accessed by Los Angeles Unified School District (District) staff and operations in the southern portion of the District. The Agreement provides for a five-year term with three options to renew the term for a period of five years each. The total base rent of this Agreement over the total five-year term is $1,027,743.97.
 
Background: 
The District’s radio communications are dependent upon antennas and microwave dishes attached to fixed radio towers located on multiple sites in and around Los Angeles County. Information Technology Services (ITS) and Los Angeles School Police Department (LASPD) have licensed a portion of the radio tower at 3690 East Crest Road since 1997, which was selected for its location and elevation to provide radio coverage to LASPD, Transportation Services Branch school bus operations, Facilities Services Division Maintenance and Operations, KLCS Public Media, the Gardena Bus Garage, several secondary schools, and a nutrition center in the South Bay area. Since the existing license agreement expired on August 1, 2024, the agreement has been operating and will operate on a month-to-month basis until a renewal agreement is executed.
 
The proposed Agreement has a five-year term with three (3) options to renew the term, each renewal term is for a period of five (5) years. The monthly base rent in the first year of the term will be $15,785.68 and will be subject to an annual fixed increase of 4%.  All other terms from the existing license agreement will apply to the renewal agreement.  
 
The District is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide coverage using this site.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approve and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Agreement and/or other reasonable instruments for tower space at Palos Verdes 1. The proposed Agreement will allow continued, safe, effective, reliable radio communication, which benefits all students and offices.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If approved, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will execute agreements necessary to keep radiofrequency transmission open for District communications.
 
If the Board does not approve and authorize the proposed action, radio communication transmission from Palos Verdes 1 will no longer be made available and an alternative site will have to be identified to ensure that radio communication lines remain open. Any new site selected must be able to provide the same or better quality of radio coverage consistent with the current location and will require all radio tower equipment to be realigned and cleared for operation by both the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation
Administration prior to use.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested action is consistent with current District policy and advances the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by continuing to provide use of radio tower space to support the District’s radio communication infrastructure.
 
Budget Impact: 
The first year of the Agreement will be for a monthly base rent payment of $15,785.68. For each subsequent year, the base rent will increase by 4%. The proposed monthly rent is comprised of direct costs and market-based rent inclusive of, but not limited to, utilities, taxes, tower height, capacity, and administration of the Agreement. In the first year of the Agreement, the annual rent for the proposed use is anticipated to be approximately $189,428.20. The following chart shows the anticipated annual rent for each year of the term:

Landlord: American Tower Asset Sub, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company
 
Rentable Area: Remote Tower Space and Radio Shelter 
 
Term: Five years and three options to extend the term for a period of five years each term
 
Previous Base Rent: $151,617.03 annually
 
Proposed Base Rent: Monthly base rent for one year is $15,785.68 and is subject to the annual adjustment of 4% 
 
The total base rent of this Agreement over the five-year term is $1,027,743.97. Funding will be provided by the General Fund, Program Code 15125.
 
Student Impact: 
The continued Agreement for the remote tower space will provide reliable radio-frequency bands for daily operations and provide information to help create safe secure environments for students across the District.
 
Equity Impact:
The existing radio tower space will be able to provide coverage to support District school police vehicles, school buses, truck operations, schools, and offices.
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The tower at Palos Verdes #1 has served the daily radio operations of the District since 1997. Given the ground terrain, elevation, slope, and tower infrastructure, staff finds the present site to be optimal to support current radio transmission needs.

Define and Approve 16 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein 
January 14, 2025
Facilities Services Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 16 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $795,482.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
 
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 12, 2024, as reference in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the school and its students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 16 proposed projects is $795,482. Eight projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects. Eight projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 8,800 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact:
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Background:

Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a no vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  A no vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.

Provisional Internship Permits
January 14, 2025
Human Resources Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 12 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
 
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005, in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document. The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed. During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit. Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new as multiple subject, special education, mathematics, and English teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits. Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact: 
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom. In areas of high need such as multiple subject, special education, mathematics, and English, where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Request for Board Approval of Education Compact with the City of Lomita
January 14, 2025
Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Education Compact with the City of Lomita.
 
Background: 
As part of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan for the Los Angeles Unified School District, new Education Compacts are to be established between the District and local governmental entities. Education Compacts with the municipal governments are intended to align resources and implement innovative programs to equip our students with the tools they need to be Ready for the World.
 
Through these Education Compacts, each city and the District will collaborate to meet the educational needs of youth and families in the respective city through the end of the District’s Strategic Plan (June 2026). The city and the District may choose to revisit the Compact after June 2026 to renew their shared commitments 
to students and families.
 
The commitments outlined in the Education Compact are not legally binding nor do they mandate budgetary expenditures on behalf of the Parties. They represent a shared philosophical goal of improving the educational opportunities and enriching the lives of children and families attending District sites living within the city. 
 
The Office of Governmental Relations (OGR) will continue discussions with other municipalities to finalize Education Compacts that can be brought forth for Board approval at a future meeting.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approved Education Compacts will result in a coherent agenda that OGR, Region Offices and the respective District Divisions will promote and advance by strengthening collaboration with each municipality to deliver on the commitments outlined in the shared vision. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval will allow OGR, Region Offices and the respective District Divisions to proceed in a timely manner to deliver on the commitments outlined in the shared vision. Delay in approval will delay the opportunity to strengthen these partnerships.
 
Policy Implications: 
The Education Compacts are in alignment with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Budget Impact: 
No budgetary expenditures are outlined in the Education Compacts.
 
Student Impact: 
The Education Compact supports students and families through strengthening partnerships between the city and the District. Such partnership ensures a coherent and joint effort to support student success. 
 
Equity Impact:

Score Rationale

 



Recognition

     3

 

The Education Compacts may establish partnerships between the District and the City of Los Angeles as well as the smaller and less representative cities and communities that also serve our student population. While approximately around 21% of Los Angeles Unified students attend schools outside of the City of Los Angeles, it is equally important for the District to continue to pursue collaborative efforts with the other cities and unincorporated communities represented by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

 



Resource Prioritization

     3

 

Pursuing these partnerships would mean that our programs and initiatives are also being replicated in other communities outside the City of Los Angeles, ultimately broadening opportunities and services to students and families in a more equitable way. 

 



Results

     2

 

The Education Compacts represent a shared philosophical goal of improving the educational opportunities and enriching the lives of children and families attending District sites within respective cities and unincorporated communities, however the commitments are not legally binding, nor do they mandate financial obligations.

Request for Approval of 2025 Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities
January 14, 2025
Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approval to sponsor legislation and proactively advocate for policies and funding proposals at the local, state and federal levels that are consistent with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Background: 
Each year the Office of Government Relations (OGR) presents to the Board proposed advocacy priorities for the upcoming year. This includes securing authors for legislation, advocating for changes/inclusion in budget and funding proposals, and taking positions on related bills, regulatory changes, and policy issues as presented on the attached documents. Given the unprecedented challenges the District has faced in recent years and the uncertainty that lies ahead, it will be important to build in flexibility to authorize the Office of Governmental Relations to pursue the necessary advocacy on other policy and funding priorities as new issues arise in 2025.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approved policy and funding priorities will result in a coherent advocacy agenda that the Office of Governmental Relations will promote and advance by building local and state coalitions with a diverse set of education partners.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval will allow OGR staff to proceed in a timely manner to secure authors for legislation and pursue advocacy with the various levels of government.  Delay in approval will negatively impact the securing of authors for legislation prior to the legislative deadlines for the introduction of bills.
 
Policy Implications: 
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support existing Board policies and are in alignment with the District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan.
 
Budget Impact: 
Costs of the proposal are borne by OGR within the existing general fund budget.
 
Student Impact: 
The Advocacy Agenda and Guiding Principles and Priorities support students and their academic achievement either directly or indirectly through legislation and policies.  Advocacy on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified community is critical to the success of students, teachers and administrators, and the advancement of our schools.

Proposition 39 Charter Facilities Compliance for the 2025-2026 School Year - Finding and Written Statements of Reasons Why Certain Charter Schools Cannot be Accommodated on a Single School Site, and Determination of Necessity to Move 
January 14, 2025
Office of the Chief Strategy Officer
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Find and adopt, pursuant to California Education Code section 47614 and its implementing regulations (“Regulations”), a written statement of reasons why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) that submitted a Proposition 39 facilities request for the 2025-2026 school year cannot be accommodated on a single school site. Also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
Background: 
With the passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000, California Education Code section 47614 (“Proposition 39”) was amended with the intent that public school facilities should be shared fairly among all public-school pupils, including those in charter schools.
 
Proposition 39 requires that school districts make available to each charter school operating in the school district, facilities that will accommodate all of the charter school’s in-district students. The facilities must be in conditions “reasonably equivalent” to those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other public schools of the district, and the school district may not move a charter school unnecessarily. For each legally sufficient facilities request submitted by a charter school to a school district, the Regulations require the school district to deliver to the charter school a preliminary proposal on or before February 1st, and a final offer on or before April 1st. 
 
The Board of Education has authorized the Superintendent (and/or their designee(s)) to issue preliminary proposals and final offers of space to all charter schools that submitted legally sufficient facilities requests, for the specific school year at issue, in accordance with requirements and timelines of Proposition 39 and the Regulations. (Board Report No. 098 - 18/19, dated October 2, 2018.)
 
The District is prepared to make preliminary proposals and final offers of space at operating District school sites to all eligible charter school applicants. While most preliminary proposals and final offers will accommodate charter schools at a single school site, some will accommodate certain charter schools (identified in the Attachments hereto) at more than one school site.
 
Section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations provides that if a school district’s preliminary proposal or final offer of space does not accommodate a charter school at a single school site, the district’s governing board must first: (i) make a finding that the charter school cannot be accommodated at a single site; and (ii) adopt a written statement of the reasons explaining the finding.
The charter schools identified in the Attachments hereto cannot be accommodated at a single site because of several factors, such as:  the large number of seats identified in the charter school’s facilities request, the lack of available classrooms on a single site in the specific area requested by the charter school, multiple charter schools’ requests for facilities at the same school site or in the same area, and/or the charter school’s request to be located at more than one school site.  In addition to design capacity and geographical limitations, and consistent with the Proposition 39 Charter Schools Co-Location Policy (Board Report No. 200 - 23/24, dated March 19, 2024), the District gave substantial consideration to District and charter students’ safety and welfare, including, but not limited to, the disproportionate harm to District students that would result from forcibly dislocating children from their neighborhood schools to make room for non-neighborhood charter students.
 
Each Attachment hereto includes the following, as mandated by Proposition 39 and the Regulations:
 
a)                     The process for staff’s determination that a particular charter school cannot be accommodated on a single site. The process included, among other things, (1) a description of how the District determined available classroom inventory to meet a charter school’s facilities request; (2) the rationale for making a multiple site offer; and (3) material considerations of student safety and welfare when balancing all available alternatives; and
 
b)                     A recommended finding that a certain charter school could not be accommodated at a single site and written statement of reasons explaining the finding, and a determination that it is necessary to move part of the charter school’s operations to an additional school site (if applicable).
 
Expected Outcomes:
As mandated by Proposition 39 and the Regulations, the Board will make findings and adopt written statements of the reasons why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) that submitted Proposition 39 facilities requests cannot be accommodated at a single school site for the 2025-2026 school year. The Board will also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If “no” vote, the District will not be in compliance with section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations requiring the Board to make findings and adopt written statements as to why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) will receive Proposition 39 preliminary proposals and/or final offers accommodating them at more than one school site.  The Board will also not determine if it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
If “yes” vote, the District will be in compliance with section 11969.2, subdivision (d) of the Regulations requiring the Board to make findings and adopt written statements as to why certain charter schools (as identified in the Attachments hereto) will receive Proposition 39 preliminary proposals and/or final offers accommodating them at more than one school site.  The Board will also determine it is necessary to move part of certain charter schools’ operations to an additional school site.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
This finding has no budget impact.
 
Student Impact: 
Pursuant to Proposition 39, public school facilities should be shared fairly among all public-school pupils, including those in charter schools. Through this proposed action, the Board is adhering to this mandate.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Pursuant to Proposition 39 and the Regulations, the District is required to make a preliminary proposal and final offer of space to each charter school that submitted a legally sufficient request for facilities. If a charter school cannot be accommodated at a single school site, the Board must first make a finding that the charter school cannot be accommodated at a single site and adopt a written statement of the reasons explaining the finding.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Crete Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for Crete Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 1 and Region South, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy.  The school’s renewal petition includes a reduction in enrollment capacity from 363 to 355.
 
Background: 
Crete Academy is a TK-6 school currently serving 283 students on two private facilities at 6103 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043, and 1729 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90062 in Board District 1 and Region South. Crete Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Crete Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, Crete Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Crete Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
•                     Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Crete Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined, Charter School shall not renew as a Low performing charter school based on performance indicators and pursuant to the statutory renewal framework. (Ed. Code § 47607.2(a).) Additionally, Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Ed. Code § 47605(c)(2).) 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the Board.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025.  The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Crete Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition, consistently with the Board’s action and direction, for a two (2) year period beginning July 1, 2025.  Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. This Board Report No. xxxx, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written factual findings for the approval of Charter School’s renewal petition consistent with Education Code section 47607.2(a)(4).
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 1. The District shall retain all state and federal special education funding allocated to the SELPA for Charter School students. The District shall be responsible for providing all appropriate special education and related services in accordance with applicable state and federal laws for Charter School students as set forth in the applicable MOU. The parties understand and agree that Charter School has an equitable financial contribution obligation under section 47646 of the Education Code. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education is 25% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period which is paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each fiscal year until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. For the remainder of Charter School’s petition period, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval, and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science and Technology Charter Middle [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle. The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 240 to 180 students. 
 
Background: 
Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle is a 5-8 school currently serving 86 students on a private facility at 15355 Morrison Street, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91403 in Board District 3 and Region North. Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2007.  On January 10, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 240 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 16, 2024, Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 14, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the renewal petition. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 153, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition     
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ivy Bound Academy of Math, Science, and Technology Charter Middle, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

Approval of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Corazón Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Corazón Academy (“Charter School”), with benchmarks in the areas of academics, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve 1042 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Charter School’s currently authorized enrollment capacity is 1,042. As part of Charter School’s renewal petition submission, Charter School included an increase of 100 students from 1,042 to 1,142. At the same time as the renewal petition submission, Charter School submitted its material revision application seeking to increase its enrollment capacity from 1,142 to 1,205 students and add a location. However, pursuant to the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, Charter School’s material revision application did not contain the information and/or documents necessary to begin processing. As such, Staff cannot process Charter School’s material revision application at this time. Staff has communicated to Charter School that the District will consider its material revision request when appropriately submitted. Staff recommends the renewal of Charter School’s petition with the currently authorized enrollment capacity of 1,042. 
 
Background: 
KIPP Corazón Academy is a TK-8 school currently serving 1055 students on two private facilities at 9325 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, and 8616 Long Beach Boulevard, South Gate, CA, 90280, in Board District 5 and Region East. KIPP Corazón Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 15, 2016. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Corazón Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Corazón Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Corazón Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:

•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 154, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Philosophers Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Philosophers Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 7 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve up to 450 students in grades 5-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
KIPP Philosophers Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 395 students on a private facility at 1999 E. 102nd Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90002, in Board District 7 and Region South. KIPP Philosophers Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Philosophers Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Philosophers Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division, seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing will be held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Philosophers Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 155, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for KIPP Scholar Academy (“Charter School”), with a benchmark in the area of academic, located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2030, to serve to up to serve 450 students in grades 5-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
KIPP Scholar Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 437 students on a private facility at 6100 S. Hoover Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90044 in Board District 1 and Region South. KIPP Scholar Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades 5-8.

Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Scholar Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Scholar Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025

This Board Report No. 156, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

Denial of the Renewal Petition for KIPP Sol Academy [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for KIPP Sol Academy  (“Charter School”), located in Board District 2 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy.
 
Background: 
KIPP Sol Academy is a 5-8 school currently serving 461 students on a private facility at 4800 E. Cesar Chavez Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90022 in Board District 2 and Region East. KIPP Sol Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on October 4, 2011.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 485 students in grades 5-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for KIPP Sol Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 17, 2024, KIPP Sol Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 15, 2025.  
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on December 10, 2024.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code 47605 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.  
 
Due Diligence:
Current KIPP Sol Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
                     
                     
                     Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
                     Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for KIPP Sol Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that petitioners are unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition, and that the charter school has not attained measurable increases in academic achievement schoolwide and for numerically significant student groups served by the charter school. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent the Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2025. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 157, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.   
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for KIPP Sol Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2025. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that meets all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy (“Charter School”), located in Board District 2 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Los Angeles Leadership Academy. The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 550 students to 490 students.
 
Background: 
Los Angeles Leadership Academy is a 6-12 school currently serving 324 students on two private facilities at 234 E. Avenue 33, Los Angeles, CA, 90031 and 2670 Griffin Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90031 in Board District 2 and Region East.  Los Angeles Leadership Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 12, 2002.  On November 15, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 550 students in grades 6-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Los Angeles Leadership Academy expires June 30, 2025.
 
On October 16, 2024, Los Angeles Leadership Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through January 14, 2025.

Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of the Proposed Material Revision for Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High (“Charter School”), to add an additional site within the community, as defined in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools. The proposed site is located at 10025 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
 
Background: 
Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 618 students on a private facility at 10101 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA, 90003 in Board District 7 and Region South. Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 12, 2005.  On September 24, 2019, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 600 students in grades 9-12.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High’s complete material revision. Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2028.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact:
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA.  An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Approval of the Proposed Material Revision for Alliance Ouichi-O'Donovan 6-12 Complex
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Approve the material revision of the charter for Alliance Ouchi-O’Donovan 6-12 Complex (“Charter School”), to add an additional site within the community, as defined in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools. The proposed additional site is located at 2516 and 2560 W. 54th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90043 in Board District 1 and Region South. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.
 
Background: 
Alliance Ouchi-O’Donovan 6-12 Complex is a 6-12 span school currently serving 995 students on a private facility at 5356 S. 5th Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90043 in Board District 1 and Region South. Alliance Ouchi-O’Donovan 6-12 Complex was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 7, 2006. On September 25, 2018, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 1,015 students in grades 6-12.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Alliance Ouchi-O’Donovan 6-12 Complex’s complete material revision. Alliance Ouchi-O’Donovan 6-12 Complex seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2027.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Denial of the Proposed Material Revision for Ingenium Charter
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter (“Charter School”), to relocate from current Proposition 39 location (Canoga Park Middle) to a new private facility outside the community. The proposed facility is located at 6425 Kester Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91405 in Board District 3 and Region North. The recommendation for denial is based on information in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report and the Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter.
 
Background: 
Ingenium Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 298 students on the campus of Canoga Park Middle, as a co-location through Proposition 39 at 22250 Elkwood Street, Canoga Park, CA, 91304 in Board District 3 and Region North. Ingenium Charter was approved by the California State Board of Education on January 5, 2010, after denial by LAUSD Board of Education. On November 19, 2019, the charter school was renewed by LAUSD for another five-year term to serve up to 611 students in grades TK-5.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Ingenium Charter’s complete material revision. Ingenium Charter seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2028.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has not met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends denial of the material revision of the charter.
 
Grounds for Denial
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the proposed material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter and have assessed that the material revision does not meet the criteria for approval. As fully discussed in the attached Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter, based on review of the proposed material revision and Community Impact Assessment, staff has determined, in accordance with Education Code sections 47605(c)(2) and 47607 (a)(4) and (b), the following:
 
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the petition; and
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school under the terms of its current charter for the remainder of the charter term.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to approve the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, under the terms of its current charter. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the charter school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised material revision to the charter that meets the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605, all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State and District Required Language. Also, within the 30-day timeline, Charter School must execute any and all documents and/or take all necessary and appropriate actions to give full force and effect to the terms, provisions, and intent of its proposed material revision. 
 
Policy Implications: 
There are no policy implications at this time.                     
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the material revision, the action will not have a budget impact. 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the material revision is approved, the impact on the budget could be the estimated revenue losses to the District schools based on the assumptions and the community fiscal impact analysis described below for Ingenium Charter’s move to a proposed new facility outside of the community. Under the facts and circumstances described below, and as a factor leading to a denial recommendation, Ingenium Charter’s application for a material revision is deemed to have a substantive fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed community.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution. 
 
Staff’s fiscal impact analysis is calculated based on multiple sourced assumptions (as reflected below) to provide a projection of Ingenium Charter’s potential fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed target community.  
 
Based on Ingenium Charter’s projected enrollment (250 students in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, increasing to 350 students by Charter School’s expected renewal year (i.e., Fiscal Year 2027-2028)), the estimated total revenue loss for the District’s schools could be $4,350,906 in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, increasing to $6,091,268 by Charter School’s renewal year and amounting to $15,663,261 over the period of Ingenium Charter’s remaining charter term. Additionally, the aggregate fiscal impact on the District and charter schools in the proposed community could be $17,025,283 over the period of Ingenium Charter’s remaining charter term. Because District revenue is associated with average daily attendance (ADA) rather than enrollment (See 5 C.C.R § 402), the estimated District revenue loss is not directly proportionally associated with the number of students who would attend the charter school. Additionally, as a result of lower enrollment to the District schools, any loss of revenue may be offset by possible reductions in expenditures for the District’s services and programs.
 
Currently, there are four (4) other charter schools serving one or more similar grade levels (Grade TK-5) within the community of Ingenium Charter’s proposed location.
 
Based on the above analysis, Charter School’s material revision request, if approved by the LAUSD Board, could substantively impact (fiscally) existing District schools in the proposed target community.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for approval of the material revision.

Denial of the Proposed Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle
January 14, 2025
Charter Schools Division
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter Middle (“Charter School”), to relocate from the current Proposition 39 co-location at John A. Sutter Middle to a new private facility. The proposed facility is located at 6425 Kester Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91405 in Board District 3 and Region North. The recommendation for denial is based on information in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report and the Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle. 
 
Background: 
Ingenium Charter Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 180 students on the campus of John A. Sutter Middle School, as a co-location through Proposition 39 at 7330 Winnetka Ave, Winnetka, CA, 91306 in Board District 4 and Region North. Ingenium Charter Middle was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 12, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for another five-year term to serve up to 270 students in grades 6-8.  
 
On September 17, 2024, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of Ingenium Charter Middle’s complete material revision. Ingenium Charter Middle seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2026.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has not met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends denial of the material revision of the charter.
 
Grounds for Denial
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the proposed material revision of the charter for Ingenium Charter Middle and have assessed that the material revision does not meet the criteria for approval. As fully discussed in the attached Denial of the Requested Material Revision for Ingenium Charter Middle, based on review of the proposed material revision and Community Impact Assessment, staff has determined, in accordance with Education Code sections 47605(c)(2) and 47607 (a)(4) and (b), the following:
 
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the petition; and
•                     Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to serve the interest of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school under the terms of its current charter for the remainder of the charter term.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to approve the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, under the terms of its current charter. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the charter school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised material revision to the charter that meets the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605, all LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and compliance with current Federal, State and District Required Language. Also, within the 30-day timeline, Charter School must execute any and all documents and/or take all necessary and appropriate actions to give full force and effect to the terms, provisions, and intent of its proposed material revision.
 
Policy Implications: 
There are no policy implications at this time.                     
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the material revision, the action will not have a budget impact. 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the material revision is approved, the impact on the budget could be the estimated revenue losses to the District schools based on the assumptions and the community fiscal impact analysis described below for Ingenium Charter Middle’s move to a proposed new facility outside of the community. Under the facts and circumstances described below, and as a factor leading to a denial recommendation, Ingenium Charter Middle’s application for a material revision is deemed to have a substantive fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed community.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution. 
 
Staff’s fiscal impact analysis is calculated based on multiple sourced assumptions (as reflected below) to provide a projection of Ingenium Charter Middle’s potential fiscal impact to existing District schools in the proposed target community.  
 
Based on Ingenium Charter Middle’s projected enrollment, 200 students in Fiscal Year 2025-2026, the charter school’s expected renewal year, the estimated total revenue loss for the District’s schools could be $2,439,638. Additionally, the aggregate fiscal impact on the District and charter schools in the proposed community could be $2,870,163 in Fiscal Year 2025-2026. Because District revenue is associated with average daily attendance (ADA) rather than enrollment (See 5 C.C.R § 402), the estimated District revenue loss is not directly proportionally associated with the number of students who would attend the charter school. Additionally, as a result of lower enrollment to the District schools, any loss of revenue may be offset by possible reductions in expenditures for the District’s services and programs.
Currently, there are five (5) other charter schools serving one or more similar grade levels (Grade 6-8) within the community of Ingenium Charter Middle’s proposed location.
 
Based on the above analysis, Charter School’s material revision request, if approved by the LAUSD Board, could substantively impact (fiscally) existing District schools in the proposed target community.
 
Student Impact: 
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s request for material revision of the charter and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for approval of the material revision.
 
Equity Impact:

description
Whereas, In alignment with the Los Angeles Unified School District (District) 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District is committed to fostering strong relationships and honoring diverse perspectives by engaging students, parents, and community partners in greening initiatives that center equity and inclusion;
 
Whereas, Consistent with Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, the District recognizes that creating welcoming, green learning environments promotes whole-child well-being, strengthens social-emotional skills, and enhances students’ ability to thrive academically and personally;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to increasing green space on campuses to 30% by 2035, prioritizing low-income communities and communities of color, through converting asphalt to green space, addressing soil contamination, and ensuring ADA compliance (Res 002-22/23);
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that strong external partnerships are critical to mitigating the financial costs of greening initiatives while amplifying their impact;
 
Whereas, The District acknowledges that meaningful engagement with Black and brown communities is essential to ensuring equity in greening initiatives and recognizes the need for robust, ongoing parent and community participation;
 
Whereas, The emerging green economy presents significant opportunities to create pathways for Black and brown students and families into sustainable, high-wage jobs that address climate challenges;
 
Whereas, Strong partnerships with labor organizations are essential to ensuring these pathways are accessible, lead to high-quality careers, and support family-sustaining wages; and
 
Whereas, Research demonstrates that community involvement in the design and implementation of green infrastructure projects is a key factor in their long-term success and sustainability; now, therefore, be it
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to community-centered greening initiatives that advance sustainability, climate resilience, and equity as demonstrated by previous resolutions, including: Transitioning LAUSD to 100% Clean, Renewable, Energy Resulting in Healthier Students and More Sustainable, Equitable, Communities (Res 018-19/20 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Board%20Resolution%20-%20100%20Percent%20Clean%20Energy%20-%202020.pdf>); Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses (Res 002-22/23 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Green-Schoolyards-For-All-Resolution.pdf>); and Climate Literacy (Res-016-21/22 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/ClimateLiteracy016-2022.pdf>);
 
Whereas, In alignment with the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkhmuidtUO1DkBVn_gUGMY68IzFCuJGX/view>, Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District prioritizes strong partnerships and inclusive engagement with community organizations, parents and students in greening efforts;
 
Whereas, The Eco-Sustainability Office (ESO) is committed to supporting the District Strategic Plan by developing and implementing programs and policies that raise awareness of environmental stewardship and provide healthy, sustainable learning environments for all LAUSD students. Among its many responsibilities, this office plays a substantial role in developing and maintaining partnerships with non-profit organizations, labor unions, businesses, government agencies, and school communities;
 
Whereas, Non-profit organizations have partnered with LAUSD for decades to promote school greening, sustainability and climate resilience. The 2024 Green Schoolyards for All Plan outlines greening projects funded by state grants including 10 projects in planning/design, 2 projects under construction, and 10 projects under feasibility studies. Over the last five years, non-profit organizations have secured over $57 million to plant trees and transform 52 schoolyards throughout the District. Also, through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL FIRE) non-profit organizations will partner with the District to implement 41 greening projects, expanding tree coverage, shade and learning opportunities;
 
Whereas, Despite their contributions, non-profit organizations leading grant-funded greening projects must cover various internal fees and services such as Owner’s Authorized Representative fees, testing requirements, design reviews, and inspections. These expenses can constitute 10-20% of the total planning and construction costs of a project. For instance, seven non-profits that have secured $34 million in grant awards for the District are being charged $3 million in fees by the District;
 
Whereas, The ESO is exploring funding solutions to address financial gaps arising after grants are awarded and is developing an updated “how-to” guide to streamline third-party greening project processes; and
 
Whereas, The ESO and Facilities Services Division (FSD) have collaborated to: (1) streamline project supervision requirements for greening projects and reduce oversight expenses; (2) develop recommendations for Design Guidelines that are tailored to school greening, and (3) consider modifications to Development Agreement language to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) expresses its sincere gratitude to all community partners, parents, and students for their dedication to fostering equitable, sustainable, and thriving learning environments, and commits to accelerating efforts to strengthen these vital relationships;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent, in collaboration with the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to invest in and strengthen external partnerships to advance greening initiatives by mitigating costs for partners through District resources, including but not limited to eligible bond funds. This includes costs associated with ADA retrofits, District staff time, project fees, and testing requirements, thereby incentivizing collaboration and maximizing the impact of greening projects. Furthermore, the Superintendent shall ensure that staffing time dedicated to these initiatives reflects the scale and complexity of each project, with a focus on streamlining processes and promoting equitable access to greening projects in underserved and marginalized communities;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall strengthen community engagement in greening initiatives prioritizing the leadership of Black and brown communities, by (1) expanding the Office of Eco-Sustainability to include culturally reflective and regional support systems, and (2) creating more opportunities for parent-led collaboration in school-based greening and climate resilience efforts;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall conduct a Green Jobs Pathways Study centered on Black and brown communities to augment partnerships with local businesses, trade unions, and educational institutions, mapping pathways into the green economy for students and families with an emphasis on creating and incentivizing opportunities that lead to high-paying careers. The study will identify emerging green sectors, such as renewable energy and sustainable construction, among others, and align existing District programs to enhance career readiness by expanding pilot initiatives and partnerships that provide internships, apprenticeships, and certifications; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Superintendent shall present to the Board within 90 days a comprehensive plan outlining the steps, timelines, and responsible parties for implementing the directives in this resolution, including clear, measurable benchmarks and goals to assess progress.
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) recognizes the vital role of non-profit organizations in creating sustainable and equitable learning environments for all students, and commits to strengthening and expanding partnerships within this sector;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to remove internal fees for non-profit organizations that lead District school greening projects regardless of funding source. Where feasible, up to $3 million in District resources, including eligible bond funds, will be allocated to cover costs such as: Owner’s Authorized Representative fees; project fees; ADA retrofits; District staff time; testing; design reviews; and inspections;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to develop an implementation plan defining eligibility criterion for non-profit organizations and projects. The plan will describe strategies to remove and/or mitigate fees, such as fee waivers, returning or reimbursing costs for fees that non-profit organizations have already paid, reclassifying internal fees as in-kind contributions, and precluding the upfront payment of fees; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to present to the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee a comprehensive plan for fee removal and a progress report on potential funding options to support third-party greening projects, within 120 days. The District will also provide a progress report on (1) the District’s “how-to” guide for greening projects requirements; (2) recommendations to streamline project supervision requirements and reduce oversight expenses; (3) development of school greening-specific Design Guidelines; and (4) potential modification to Development Agreements to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, Los Angeles is experiencing a housing crisis, and skyrocketing rents and home prices are leading to higher costs of living and increasing levels of homelessness. The Affordable Housing Outcomes Report presented to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in September 2023, found that the County lacks over 500,000 affordable homes to meet the current demand among renter households at or below 50 percent of the area median income;
 
Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District (District) employees commute long distances to serve our students while seeking reasonably priced rentals and homes outside District boundaries; 
 
Whereas, The District operates 1,200 schools and centers and owns 21,000 buildings-more than 78 million square feet-and 6,400 acres or 10 square miles of land; 
 
Whereas, The District has underutilized assets including closed schools or other facilities, former agricultural land, and portions of school sites with excess storage;
 
Whereas, Joint occupancy and other legal vehicles allow the District to enter into public-private partnerships to leverage underutilized assets for the purpose of providing value to the District;
 
Whereas, Starting in 2015, the District has utilized specific District-owned properties to provide 185 units of affordable family housing-with preference given to District staff and employees-at Sage Park in Gardena, Selma Community Housing in Hollywood, and Norwood Learning Village in Los Angeles; 
 
Whereas, Currently, over 7,000 District employees are on the waitlist for housing at the three existing projects;
 
Whereas, Providing employee housing will help make the District an employer of choice by helping attract and retain qualified teachers and staff, reducing commute times to and from work which has a positive impact on the environment, and alleviating the regional housing shortage; 
 
Whereas, In September 2016, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously passed “Exploring Options to Develop Workforce Housing in Sun Valley for Employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District” which directed the Superintendent to study the development of additional workforce housing;
 
Whereas, In March 2017, the Facilities and Audit Committee received a presentation entitled, “Using Underutilized Assets to Address District Goals and Priorities;” 
Whereas, In November 2018, the Board passed “Increasing Opportunities and Supports for Our Homeless Students and Families” in order to support students and families experiencing homelessness;
 
Whereas, In June 2020, The Superintendent presented a Real Estate Evaluation detailing the 21,000 District owned buildings across 6,400 acres of land. The goal was to develop 2,000 units of housing for LA Unified employees, including teachers;
 
Whereas, In November 2020, the Superintendent recommended that the Board approve the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFPs) seeking proposals for the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of three District properties and consider proposals for employee housing at 10 vacant District properties; 
 
Whereas, In June 2021, the District launched a new effort to provide affordable housing which would allow District teachers, staff and families to live in the communities they serve. The Board authorized $1.5 million from the General Fund to conduct due diligence activities for the purpose of identifying options to provide affordable employee housing;
 
Whereas, In Fall 2023, the District released a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) for the development and financing of housing for District employees and families. It garnered responses from development firms and financial institutions willing to support the District's housing initiative. The below preliminary sites identified in the REI included nine District owned sites that were vacant and/or underutilized and not part of a school:
 
•                     Paved parking lot located at 4523 Exposition Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90016;
•                     Vacant parcel adjacent to Vista Hermosa Park;
•                     Vacant lot located at the intersection of Shoup Ave. and Collins St.;
•                     Multiple portable buildings and parking lot located at 1049 N. Fairfax Ave. West Hollywood, CA 90046;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 2726 Francis Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90005;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 644 E 56th St. Los Angeles, CA 90011;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 234 E 112th St. Los Angeles, CA 90061;
•                     Vacant 3-story medical building, surface parking, and storage building located at 10339 Balboa Blvd. Granada Hills, CA 91344; and
•                     Vacant unimproved lot located at 4315 New York Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90022
 
Whereas, In November 2023, a Community Briefing was held to discuss the District’s initiative regarding affordable housing and preview the survey to assess housing heeds;
 
Whereas, In May 2024, the District surveyed employees and families to gauge interest in a range of housing options. Data from the survey is meant to support the District's efforts to potentially repurpose underutilized real estate assets to provide housing that is more affordable for employees and families; 
 
Whereas, In October 2024, the Facilities and Procurement committee heard an update on the District's Housing Initiative; and
 
Whereas, Despite the extensive timeline and current demand for housing, the District has not yet released RFPs for workforce housing for over a decade and can’t say with certainty when they will be released; now, therefore be it 
 
Resolved, At the Committee of the Whole meeting on January 28, 2025, the Los Angeles Unified School District shall present to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the public the following:
 
•                     Data collected from the Housing Survey and appropriate analysis; 
•                     Plan to solicit proposals by June 1, 2025, for the nine vacant and/or underutilized sites identified in the REI to create additional affordable workforce housing units;
•                     Timeline of key dates and activities from now through the proposed completion of the aforementioned units; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall provide quarterly reports to the Board outlining progress towards the development of employee housing units until they are completed.",,,,,,,,

Request for Board Authority to Pursue a Two-Year Extension to the Waiver of a Portion of Education Code 45272(a) [PUBLIC HEARING]
January 14, 2025
Personnel Commission & Office of Government Relations
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Office of Governmental Relations, in coordination with the Personnel Commission, to seek a two-year extension to the previously authorized waiver of a portion of Education Code 45272 (a), so that hiring appointments may be made by schools from other than the first three ranks of eligible applicants on the eligibility list for certain classified school-based entry level positions. The current two-year waiver will expire on June 30, 2025.
 
Background: 
At the Board’s December 7, 2021, meeting, the Board approved the Office of Government Relations (OGR) staff to seek a two-year waiver of a portion of Education Code 45272 (a) to the State Board of Education (SBE). 
 
Education Code 45272(a) reads:
(a) All vacancies in the classified service shall be filled pursuant to this article and the rules of the commission, from applicants on eligibility lists which, wherever practicable, as determined by the commission, shall be made up from promotional examinations, or appointments may be made by means of transfer, demotion, reinstatement, and reemployment in accordance with the rules of the commission. All applicants for promotional examinations shall have the required amount of service in classes designated by the commission or meet the minimum qualifications of education, training, experience, and length of service, which shall be determined by the commission to be appropriate for the class for which they have applied…Appointments shall be made from the eligibles having the first three ranks on the list who are ready and willing to accept the position.
 
OGR staff submitted for and obtained a waiver for the classifications of Building and Grounds Worker, Food Service Worker, and Special Education Trainee/Assistant. The SBE granted the waiver for only one year since this was a new request and recommended that the effectiveness of the waiver be studied. The conditions of the waiver also allowed Los Angeles Unified to submit for an extension if the waiver helped to increase the hiring rate of the selected classifications. 
 
On April 18, 2023, the Board approved a request from OGR staff to seek an extension to the waiver, and to add two new positions, Office Technician and Library Aide, to the positions that were eligible for the waiver. This waiver was granted, and is effective from July 3, 2023, to June 30, 2025. Staff recommends seeking an additional extension to this waiver for the five positions that currently benefit from that flexibility. The circumstances that necessitated a waiver have not changed, as described below. Additionally, expanded district programs will require expeditious hiring of Outdoor Education Assistants to serve our students. As such, we are recommending the waiver include this additional classification. 
The process entailed in Education Code 45272(a) requires that offers of employment be made to the top three candidates on any such eligibility list before any other candidates on the list can be made offers of employment. The process of doing so results in numerous vacancies waiting to be filled at various school sites if the top three ranks of candidates are not available or have interviewed at other schools and accepted offers. 
 
The waiver has allowed certain school-based, entry level positions to be filled simultaneously at various schools throughout the District. This flexibility has resulted in increased rates of hiring, as demonstrated by the chart below:

As required by the SBE waiver process, the Parent Advisory Committee and affected labor groups were consulted regarding this waiver request.
 
Expected Outcomes:
That the granting of a two-year extension to the waiver will result in faster job offers to fill vacancies at schools for more candidates. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may approve the proposal, and the Office of Governmental Relations will proceed to seek the extension to the waiver from the SBE, as stated. The Board may elect not to approve the proposal and the rate of filling vacancies at schools will return to being governed by three-ranks rule effective July 1, 2025, which will delay the hiring of qualified candidates for entry-level positions at school sites.
 
Policy Implications: 
If granted, the extended waiver will modify the way in which hiring for entry-level classified candidates at school sites are prioritized, based on the candidates’ position on the eligibility list. All candidates on the eligibility list will be eligible for hire immediately.
 
Budget Impact: 
Not Applicable
Student Impact: 
Filling school-based vacancies faster positively impacts students as incumbents in these positions provide direct services for students, and staff is relieved of the burden of performing tasks outside of their job classification during a prolonged hiring process. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If an extended waiver is granted, the use of the waiver would be limited to entry-level positions for which an external recruitment is utilized to fill many vacancies. The rule of three ranks would still be followed for positions in non-school offices.

Adoption of Authorization to Execute Certain Contracts Without Advertising or Inviting Bids to Respond Effectively to the January 2025 Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions; Resolution Declaring Emergency Conditions Exist at Los Angeles Unified Schools and Offices

Office of the Superintendent
 
Body
Action Proposed: 
Staff proposes that the Board of Education (“Board”) take the following actions related to the emergency conditions related to the life-threatening, destructive, widespread severe windstorm and resulting significant high risk and dangerous fire weather conditions, including active fires in and around the Pacific Palisades and Altadena/Pasadena areas (the “Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions”) being experienced by the District.
 
1.                     Adopt a Resolution, attached hereto, declaring that emergency conditions, both structural and health related, exist throughout multiple District schools and offices (collectively known as “District Sites”) as a result of the Severe Windstorm and Fire Conditions.
 
2.                     Authorize, by unanimous vote, under the provisions of section 20113 of the California Public Contract Code, the Superintendent and/or his designee(s) to enter into any and all contracts necessary for the procurement of materials and services necessary for the District to address the emergency conditions (health, safety, and property) caused directly or indirectly by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions as well as property damage mitigation measures (“Emergency Contracts”), without advertising or inviting bids, and for any dollar amount necessary to respond to the emergency conditions at District sites; and, notwithstanding section 20114, authorize the use of day labor or force account labor for the purpose. This delegation will expire on June 30, 2025, unless otherwise rescinded or extended by the Board of Education. Any Emergency Contracts issued shall be presented to the Board for ratification; and monthly updates shall be provided if contracts are issued.
 
3.                     Authorize the Superintendent and/or his designee to take any and all actions necessary to address the emergency conditions including giving effect to the Emergency Contracts to help ensure the continuation of public education, the health and safety of District students and staff, and the repair and restoration of District property in response to the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions. 
Background:
Beginning on January 7, 2025, major wildfires, fueled by hurricane force winds, rapidly spread throughout significant portions of Los Angeles Unified. Massive devastation resulted in the impacted communities, and continues to occur in communities, homes, and schools causing Governor Gavin Newsom to proclaim a state of emergency. Fires continue to rage throughout communities containing District Sites, causing major air quality hazards, property damage, evacuation orders, the closure of District schools and offices, and strain on resources available to the District’s students and staff. 
 
 
This Resolution will give the Superintendent and/or his designee(s) the ability to procure materials, resources, and services, in an expeditious manner, to address damage that has already occurred, mitigate further property damage, ensure student and staff safety, provide resources to communities within the District’s boundaries, and facilitate efforts to return students to effective and safe learning environments. 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the attached Resolution declaring that emergency conditions exist at District Sites and within the communities served by the District Sites. It is further anticipated that the Board of Education will authorize the Superintendent to take any and all actions necessary to procure and enter into Emergency Contracts to ensure the health and safety of students, staff, and community, and return the continuity of public education, mitigate and/or address any damage to District Sites caused by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions. Moreover, it is anticipated that the Board will authorize the use of day labor and force account labor that may exceed the hourly and cost of materials limitations set forth in section 20114.  
Board Options and Consequences:
If the Board of Education does not approve the proposed actions contained in this Board Report, staff will be unable to take immediate and necessary procurement actions to protect the health and safety of students, staff, and District Sites, and to ensure the delivery of in-person instruction. Any such contracts necessary to address the significant challenges posed by the Severe Windstorm and Wildfire Conditions over the existing delegated authority, would need to go through a bid process and Board approval. 
Policy Implications:
The proposed actions are consistent with Rules 1757 and 1758 of the Rules of the Board of Education. 
Budget Impact:
There will be an impact to the budget. At this time, the amount is unknown and unpredictable.
 
Student Impact:
This helps to protect student health and safety while ensuring the continuity of instruction in an educational environment that will help students achieve their educational goals.
 
Equity Impact:
None.
 
Issues and Analysis:
See attached Resolution.

Whereas, In alignment with the Los Angeles Unified School District (District) 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District is committed to fostering strong relationships and honoring diverse perspectives by engaging students, parents, and community partners in greening initiatives that center equity and inclusion;
 
Whereas, Consistent with Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, the District recognizes that creating welcoming, green learning environments promotes whole-child well-being, strengthens social-emotional skills, and enhances students’ ability to thrive academically and personally;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to increasing green space on campuses to 30% by 2035, prioritizing low-income communities and communities of color, through converting asphalt to green space, addressing soil contamination, and ensuring ADA compliance (Res 002-22/23);
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that strong external partnerships are critical to mitigating the financial costs of greening initiatives while amplifying their impact;
 
Whereas, The District acknowledges that meaningful engagement with Black and brown communities is essential to ensuring equity in greening initiatives and recognizes the need for robust, ongoing parent and community participation;
 
Whereas, The emerging green economy presents significant opportunities to create pathways for Black and brown students and families into sustainable, high-wage jobs that address climate challenges;
 
Whereas, Strong partnerships with labor organizations are essential to ensuring these pathways are accessible, lead to high-quality careers, and support family-sustaining wages; and
 
Whereas, Research demonstrates that community involvement in the design and implementation of green infrastructure projects is a key factor in their long-term success and sustainability; now, therefore, be it
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to community-centered greening initiatives that advance sustainability, climate resilience, and equity as demonstrated by previous resolutions, including: Transitioning LAUSD to 100% Clean, Renewable, Energy Resulting in Healthier Students and More Sustainable, Equitable, Communities (Res 018-19/20 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Board%20Resolution%20-%20100%20Percent%20Clean%20Energy%20-%202020.pdf>); Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses (Res 002-22/23 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Green-Schoolyards-For-All-Resolution.pdf>); and Climate Literacy (Res-016-21/22 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/ClimateLiteracy016-2022.pdf>);
 
Whereas, In alignment with the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkhmuidtUO1DkBVn_gUGMY68IzFCuJGX/view>, Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District prioritizes strong partnerships and inclusive engagement with community organizations, parents and students in greening efforts;
 
Whereas, The Eco-Sustainability Office (ESO) is committed to supporting the District Strategic Plan by developing and implementing programs and policies that raise awareness of environmental stewardship and provide healthy, sustainable learning environments for all LAUSD students. Among its many responsibilities, this office plays a substantial role in developing and maintaining partnerships with non-profit organizations, labor unions, businesses, government agencies, and school communities;
 
Whereas, Non-profit organizations have partnered with LAUSD for decades to promote school greening, sustainability and climate resilience. The 2024 Green Schoolyards for All Plan outlines greening projects funded by state grants including 10 projects in planning/design, 2 projects under construction, and 10 projects under feasibility studies. Over the last five years, non-profit organizations have secured over $57 million to plant trees and transform 52 schoolyards throughout the District. Also, through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL FIRE) non-profit organizations will partner with the District to implement 41 greening projects, expanding tree coverage, shade and learning opportunities;
 
Whereas, Despite their contributions, non-profit organizations leading grant-funded greening projects must cover various internal fees and services such as Owner’s Authorized Representative fees, testing requirements, design reviews, and inspections. These expenses can constitute 10-20% of the total planning and construction costs of a project. For instance, seven non-profits that have secured $34 million in grant awards for the District are being charged $3 million in fees by the District;
 
Whereas, The ESO is exploring funding solutions to address financial gaps arising after grants are awarded and is developing an updated “how-to” guide to streamline third-party greening project processes; and
 
Whereas, The ESO and Facilities Services Division (FSD) have collaborated to: (1) streamline project supervision requirements for greening projects and reduce oversight expenses; (2) develop recommendations for Design Guidelines that are tailored to school greening, and (3) consider modifications to Development Agreement language to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) expresses its sincere gratitude to all community partners, parents, and students for their dedication to fostering equitable, sustainable, and thriving learning environments, and commits to accelerating efforts to strengthen these vital relationships;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent, in collaboration with the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to invest in and strengthen external partnerships to advance greening initiatives by mitigating costs for partners through District resources, including but not limited to eligible bond funds. This includes costs associated with ADA retrofits, District staff time, project fees, and testing requirements, thereby incentivizing collaboration and maximizing the impact of greening projects. Furthermore, the Superintendent shall ensure that staffing time dedicated to these initiatives reflects the scale and complexity of each project, with a focus on streamlining processes and promoting equitable access to greening projects in underserved and marginalized communities;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall strengthen community engagement in greening initiatives prioritizing the leadership of Black and brown communities, by (1) expanding the Office of Eco-Sustainability to include culturally reflective and regional support systems, and (2) creating more opportunities for parent-led collaboration in school-based greening and climate resilience efforts;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall conduct a Green Jobs Pathways Study centered on Black and brown communities to augment partnerships with local businesses, trade unions, and educational institutions, mapping pathways into the green economy for students and families with an emphasis on creating and incentivizing opportunities that lead to high-paying careers. The study will identify emerging green sectors, such as renewable energy and sustainable construction, among others, and align existing District programs to enhance career readiness by expanding pilot initiatives and partnerships that provide internships, apprenticeships, and certifications; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Superintendent shall present to the Board within 90 days a comprehensive plan outlining the steps, timelines, and responsible parties for implementing the directives in this resolution, including clear, measurable benchmarks and goals to assess progress.
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) recognizes the vital role of non-profit organizations in creating sustainable and equitable learning environments for all students, and commits to strengthening and expanding partnerships within this sector;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to remove internal fees for non-profit organizations that lead District school greening projects regardless of funding source. Where feasible, up to $3 million in District resources, including eligible bond funds, will be allocated to cover costs such as: Owner’s Authorized Representative fees; project fees; ADA retrofits; District staff time; testing; design reviews; and inspections;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to develop an implementation plan defining eligibility criterion for non-profit organizations and projects. The plan will describe strategies to remove and/or mitigate fees, such as fee waivers, returning or reimbursing costs for fees that non-profit organizations have already paid, reclassifying internal fees as in-kind contributions, and precluding the upfront payment of fees; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to present to the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee a comprehensive plan for fee removal and a progress report on potential funding options to support third-party greening projects, within 120 days. The District will also provide a progress report on (1) the District’s “how-to” guide for greening projects requirements; (2) recommendations to streamline project supervision requirements and reduce oversight expenses; (3) development of school greening-specific Design Guidelines; and (4) potential modification to Development Agreements to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, Los Angeles is experiencing a housing crisis, and skyrocketing rents and home prices are leading to higher costs of living and increasing levels of homelessness. The Affordable Housing Outcomes Report presented to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in September 2023, found that the County lacks over 500,000 affordable homes to meet the current demand among renter households at or below 50 percent of the area median income;
 
Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District (District) employees commute long distances to serve our students while seeking reasonably priced rentals and homes outside District boundaries; 
 
Whereas, The District operates 1,200 schools and centers and owns 21,000 buildings-more than 78 million square feet-and 6,400 acres or 10 square miles of land; 
 
Whereas, The District has underutilized assets including closed schools or other facilities, former agricultural land, and portions of school sites with excess storage;
 
Whereas, Joint occupancy and other legal vehicles allow the District to enter into public-private partnerships to leverage underutilized assets for the purpose of providing value to the District;
 
Whereas, Starting in 2015, the District has utilized specific District-owned properties to provide 185 units of affordable family housing-with preference given to District staff and employees-at Sage Park in Gardena, Selma Community Housing in Hollywood, and Norwood Learning Village in Los Angeles; 
 
Whereas, Currently, over 7,000 District employees are on the waitlist for housing at the three existing projects;
 
Whereas, Providing employee housing will help make the District an employer of choice by helping attract and retain qualified teachers and staff, reducing commute times to and from work which has a positive impact on the environment, and alleviating the regional housing shortage; 
 
Whereas, In September 2016, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously passed “Exploring Options to Develop Workforce Housing in Sun Valley for Employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District” which directed the Superintendent to study the development of additional workforce housing;
 
Whereas, In March 2017, the Facilities and Audit Committee received a presentation entitled, “Using Underutilized Assets to Address District Goals and Priorities;” 
Whereas, In November 2018, the Board passed “Increasing Opportunities and Supports for Our Homeless Students and Families” in order to support students and families experiencing homelessness;
 
Whereas, In June 2020, The Superintendent presented a Real Estate Evaluation detailing the 21,000 District owned buildings across 6,400 acres of land. The goal was to develop 2,000 units of housing for LA Unified employees, including teachers;
 
Whereas, In November 2020, the Superintendent recommended that the Board approve the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFPs) seeking proposals for the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of three District properties and consider proposals for employee housing at 10 vacant District properties; 
 
Whereas, In June 2021, the District launched a new effort to provide affordable housing which would allow District teachers, staff and families to live in the communities they serve. The Board authorized $1.5 million from the General Fund to conduct due diligence activities for the purpose of identifying options to provide affordable employee housing;
 
Whereas, In Fall 2023, the District released a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) for the development and financing of housing for District employees and families. It garnered responses from development firms and financial institutions willing to support the District's housing initiative. The below preliminary sites identified in the REI included nine District owned sites that were vacant and/or underutilized and not part of a school:
 
•                     Paved parking lot located at 4523 Exposition Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90016;
•                     Vacant parcel adjacent to Vista Hermosa Park;
•                     Vacant lot located at the intersection of Shoup Ave. and Collins St.;
•                     Multiple portable buildings and parking lot located at 1049 N. Fairfax Ave. West Hollywood, CA 90046;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 2726 Francis Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90005;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 644 E 56th St. Los Angeles, CA 90011;

Whereas, In November 2023, a Community Briefing was held to discuss the District’s initiative regarding affordable housing and preview the survey to assess housing heeds;
 
Whereas, In May 2024, the District surveyed employees and families to gauge interest in a range of housing options. Data from the survey is meant to support the District's efforts to potentially repurpose underutilized real estate assets to provide housing that is more affordable for employees and families; 
 
Whereas, In October 2024, the Facilities and Procurement committee heard an update on the District's Housing Initiative; and
 
Whereas, Despite the extensive timeline and current demand for housing, the District has not yet released RFPs for workforce housing for over a decade and can’t say with certainty when they will be released; now, therefore be it 
 
Resolved, At the Committee of the Whole meeting on January 28, 2025, the Los Angeles Unified School District shall present to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the public the following:
 
•                     Data collected from the Housing Survey and appropriate analysis; 
•                     Plan to solicit proposals by June 1, 2025, for the nine vacant and/or underutilized sites identified in the REI to create additional affordable workforce housing units;
•                     Timeline of key dates and activities from now through the proposed completion of the aforementioned units; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall provide quarterly reports to the Board outlining progress towards the development of employee housing units until they are completed.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, In alignment with the Los Angeles Unified School District (District) 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District is committed to fostering strong relationships and honoring diverse perspectives by engaging students, parents, and community partners in greening initiatives that center equity and inclusion;
 
Whereas, Consistent with Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, the District recognizes that creating welcoming, green learning environments promotes whole-child well-being, strengthens social-emotional skills, and enhances students’ ability to thrive academically and personally;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to increasing green space on campuses to 30% by 2035, prioritizing low-income communities and communities of color, through converting asphalt to green space, addressing soil contamination, and ensuring ADA compliance (Res 002-22/23);
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that strong external partnerships are critical to mitigating the financial costs of greening initiatives while amplifying their impact;
 
Whereas, The District acknowledges that meaningful engagement with Black and brown communities is essential to ensuring equity in greening initiatives and recognizes the need for robust, ongoing parent and community participation;
 
Whereas, The emerging green economy presents significant opportunities to create pathways for Black and brown students and families into sustainable, high-wage jobs that address climate challenges;
 
Whereas, Strong partnerships with labor organizations are essential to ensuring these pathways are accessible, lead to high-quality careers, and support family-sustaining wages; and
 
Whereas, Research demonstrates that community involvement in the design and implementation of green infrastructure projects is a key factor in their long-term success and sustainability; now, therefore, be it
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to community-centered greening initiatives that advance sustainability, climate resilience, and equity as demonstrated by previous resolutions, including: Transitioning LAUSD to 100% Clean, Renewable, Energy Resulting in Healthier Students and More Sustainable, Equitable, Communities (Res 018-19/20 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Board%20Resolution%20-%20100%20Percent%20Clean%20Energy%20-%202020.pdf>); Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses (Res 002-22/23 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/Green-Schoolyards-For-All-Resolution.pdf>); and Climate Literacy (Res-016-21/22 <https://www.lausd.org/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/1500/ClimateLiteracy016-2022.pdf>);
 
Whereas, In alignment with the District 2022-2026 Strategic Plan <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkhmuidtUO1DkBVn_gUGMY68IzFCuJGX/view>, Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, the District prioritizes strong partnerships and inclusive engagement with community organizations, parents and students in greening efforts;
 
Whereas, The Eco-Sustainability Office (ESO) is committed to supporting the District Strategic Plan by developing and implementing programs and policies that raise awareness of environmental stewardship and provide healthy, sustainable learning environments for all LAUSD students. Among its many responsibilities, this office plays a substantial role in developing and maintaining partnerships with non-profit organizations, labor unions, businesses, government agencies, and school communities;
 
Whereas, Non-profit organizations have partnered with LAUSD for decades to promote school greening, sustainability and climate resilience. The 2024 Green Schoolyards for All Plan outlines greening projects funded by state grants including 10 projects in planning/design, 2 projects under construction, and 10 projects under feasibility studies. Over the last five years, non-profit organizations have secured over $57 million to plant trees and transform 52 schoolyards throughout the District. Also, through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL FIRE) non-profit organizations will partner with the District to implement 41 greening projects, expanding tree coverage, shade and learning opportunities;
 
Whereas, Despite their contributions, non-profit organizations leading grant-funded greening projects must cover various internal fees and services such as Owner’s Authorized Representative fees, testing requirements, design reviews, and inspections. These expenses can constitute 10-20% of the total planning and construction costs of a project. For instance, seven non-profits that have secured $34 million in grant awards for the District are being charged $3 million in fees by the District;
 
Whereas, The ESO is exploring funding solutions to address financial gaps arising after grants are awarded and is developing an updated “how-to” guide to streamline third-party greening project processes; and
 
Whereas, The ESO and Facilities Services Division (FSD) have collaborated to: (1) streamline project supervision requirements for greening projects and reduce oversight expenses; (2) develop recommendations for Design Guidelines that are tailored to school greening, and (3) consider modifications to Development Agreement language to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) expresses its sincere gratitude to all community partners, parents, and students for their dedication to fostering equitable, sustainable, and thriving learning environments, and commits to accelerating efforts to strengthen these vital relationships;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent, in collaboration with the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to invest in and strengthen external partnerships to advance greening initiatives by mitigating costs for partners through District resources, including but not limited to eligible bond funds. This includes costs associated with ADA retrofits, District staff time, project fees, and testing requirements, thereby incentivizing collaboration and maximizing the impact of greening projects. Furthermore, the Superintendent shall ensure that staffing time dedicated to these initiatives reflects the scale and complexity of each project, with a focus on streamlining processes and promoting equitable access to greening projects in underserved and marginalized communities;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall strengthen community engagement in greening initiatives prioritizing the leadership of Black and brown communities, by (1) expanding the Office of Eco-Sustainability to include culturally reflective and regional support systems, and (2) creating more opportunities for parent-led collaboration in school-based greening and climate resilience efforts;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall conduct a Green Jobs Pathways Study centered on Black and brown communities to augment partnerships with local businesses, trade unions, and educational institutions, mapping pathways into the green economy for students and families with an emphasis on creating and incentivizing opportunities that lead to high-paying careers. The study will identify emerging green sectors, such as renewable energy and sustainable construction, among others, and align existing District programs to enhance career readiness by expanding pilot initiatives and partnerships that provide internships, apprenticeships, and certifications; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Superintendent shall present to the Board within 90 days a comprehensive plan outlining the steps, timelines, and responsible parties for implementing the directives in this resolution, including clear, measurable benchmarks and goals to assess progress.
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) recognizes the vital role of non-profit organizations in creating sustainable and equitable learning environments for all students, and commits to strengthening and expanding partnerships within this sector;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to remove internal fees for non-profit organizations that lead District school greening projects regardless of funding source. Where feasible, up to $3 million in District resources, including eligible bond funds, will be allocated to cover costs such as: Owner’s Authorized Representative fees; project fees; ADA retrofits; District staff time; testing; design reviews; and inspections;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to develop an implementation plan defining eligibility criterion for non-profit organizations and projects. The plan will describe strategies to remove and/or mitigate fees, such as fee waivers, returning or reimbursing costs for fees that non-profit organizations have already paid, reclassifying internal fees as in-kind contributions, and precluding the upfront payment of fees; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to present to the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee a comprehensive plan for fee removal and a progress report on potential funding options to support third-party greening projects, within 120 days. The District will also provide a progress report on (1) the District’s “how-to” guide for greening projects requirements; (2) recommendations to streamline project supervision requirements and reduce oversight expenses; (3) development of school greening-specific Design Guidelines; and (4) potential modification to Development Agreements to reduce unnecessary burdens on greening partners.",,,,,,,,

Body
description
Whereas, Los Angeles is experiencing a housing crisis, and skyrocketing rents and home prices are leading to higher costs of living and increasing levels of homelessness. The Affordable Housing Outcomes Report presented to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in September 2023, found that the County lacks over 500,000 affordable homes to meet the current demand among renter households at or below 50 percent of the area median income;
 
Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District (District) employees commute long distances to serve our students while seeking reasonably priced rentals and homes outside District boundaries; 
 
Whereas, The District operates 1,200 schools and centers and owns 21,000 buildings-more than 78 million square feet-and 6,400 acres or 10 square miles of land; 
 
Whereas, The District has underutilized assets including closed schools or other facilities, former agricultural land, and portions of school sites with excess storage;
 
Whereas, Joint occupancy and other legal vehicles allow the District to enter into public-private partnerships to leverage underutilized assets for the purpose of providing value to the District;
 
Whereas, Starting in 2015, the District has utilized specific District-owned properties to provide 185 units of affordable family housing-with preference given to District staff and employees-at Sage Park in Gardena, Selma Community Housing in Hollywood, and Norwood Learning Village in Los Angeles; 
 
Whereas, Currently, over 7,000 District employees are on the waitlist for housing at the three existing projects;
 
Whereas, Providing employee housing will help make the District an employer of choice by helping attract and retain qualified teachers and staff, reducing commute times to and from work which has a positive impact on the environment, and alleviating the regional housing shortage; 
 
Whereas, In September 2016, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously passed “Exploring Options to Develop Workforce Housing in Sun Valley for Employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District” which directed the Superintendent to study the development of additional workforce housing;
 
Whereas, In March 2017, the Facilities and Audit Committee received a presentation entitled, “Using Underutilized Assets to Address District Goals and Priorities;” 
Whereas, In November 2018, the Board passed “Increasing Opportunities and Supports for Our Homeless Students and Families” in order to support students and families experiencing homelessness;
 
Whereas, In June 2020, The Superintendent presented a Real Estate Evaluation detailing the 21,000 District owned buildings across 6,400 acres of land. The goal was to develop 2,000 units of housing for LA Unified employees, including teachers;
 
Whereas, In November 2020, the Superintendent recommended that the Board approve the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFPs) seeking proposals for the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of three District properties and consider proposals for employee housing at 10 vacant District properties; 
 
Whereas, In June 2021, the District launched a new effort to provide affordable housing which would allow District teachers, staff and families to live in the communities they serve. The Board authorized $1.5 million from the General Fund to conduct due diligence activities for the purpose of identifying options to provide affordable employee housing;
 
Whereas, In Fall 2023, the District released a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) for the development and financing of housing for District employees and families. It garnered responses from development firms and financial institutions willing to support the District's housing initiative. The below preliminary sites identified in the REI included nine District owned sites that were vacant and/or underutilized and not part of a school:
 
•                     Paved parking lot located at 4523 Exposition Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90016;
•                     Vacant parcel adjacent to Vista Hermosa Park;
•                     Vacant lot located at the intersection of Shoup Ave. and Collins St.;
•                     Multiple portable buildings and parking lot located at 1049 N. Fairfax Ave. West Hollywood, CA 90046;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 2726 Francis Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90005;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 644 E 56th St. Los Angeles, CA 90011;
•                     Vacant paved lot located at 234 E 112th St. Los Angeles, CA 90061;
•                     Vacant 3-story medical building, surface parking, and storage building located at 10339 Balboa Blvd. Granada Hills, CA 91344; and
•                     Vacant unimproved lot located at 4315 New York Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90022
 
Whereas, In November 2023, a Community Briefing was held to discuss the District’s initiative regarding affordable housing and preview the survey to assess housing heeds;
 
Whereas, In May 2024, the District surveyed employees and families to gauge interest in a range of housing options. Data from the survey is meant to support the District's efforts to potentially repurpose underutilized real estate assets to provide housing that is more affordable for employees and families; 
 
Whereas, In October 2024, the Facilities and Procurement committee heard an update on the District's Housing Initiative; and
 
Whereas, Despite the extensive timeline and current demand for housing, the District has not yet released RFPs for workforce housing for over a decade and can’t say with certainty when they will be released; now, therefore be it 
 
Resolved, At the Committee of the Whole meeting on January 28, 2025, the Los Angeles Unified School District shall present to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the public the following:
 
•                     Data collected from the Housing Survey and appropriate analysis; 
•                     Plan to solicit proposals by June 1, 2025, for the nine vacant and/or underutilized sites identified in the REI to create additional affordable workforce housing units;
•                     Timeline of key dates and activities from now through the proposed completion of the aforementioned units; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall provide quarterly reports to the Board outlining progress towards the development of employee housing units until they are completed.",,,,,,,,

Policy Implications: 
If tentatively adopted, the Board may determine the Instructional Calendar by its own process, including days on which the schools are closed in observance of holidays. Adoption of the Instructional Calendars is tentative and conditioned on and subject to the outcome of negotiations with the unions regarding their employees’ work year calendars.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no net impact on the District’s Budget.
 
Student Impact:
Students will have 180 days of instruction and meet the State guidelines on instructional minutes required to graduate.
 
Equity Impact:
All students will follow the same number of required instructional days throughout the District. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The State Board of Education requires Local Educational Agencies to have 180 instructional days. 
 
To provide the resources and multi-tiered systems of support for each school community and student, a process will be identified to allocate additional resources to schools to provide additional instructional days to meet specific student needs, more time for direct students’ instruction or professional development to directly improve student services.

Brief Description:
(Renewal of the Transition Partnership Program (TPP) Contract for 2025-2028) Recommends approval to extend the Transition Partnership Program contract with the Department of Rehabilitation for 2025-2028 to provide services and work-based learning for LAUSD students with disabilities.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the continuation of the Transition Partnership Program contract with the Department of Rehabilitation for the 2025-2028 school years in order to continue to provide identified LAUSD students with disabilities specified services and work-based learning experiences leading to future employment. Board approval for this contract is required by the State of California Department of Rehabilitation prior to contract implementation.
end
 
Body
Background: 
There are four Department of Rehabilitation Districts which serve the schools within the boundaries of the LAUSD: Los Angeles South Bay District, Greater Los Angeles District, Van Nuys/Foothill District, and Blind Field Services (serving students with visual impairments). This contract establishes an agreement between LAUSD and each of the four named DOR Districts.
 
This contract provides federal funding from the California Department of Rehabilitation to LAUSD for the provision of services to identified students with disabilities by the staff of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Division of Special Education, District Office of Transition Services. Services include job exploration counseling, workplace readiness training, work-based learning experiences (including paid and unpaid work experience placement), instruction in self-advocacy, and counseling on post-secondary educational programs. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
In each year of the contract, 750 unduplicated students with disabilities will receive services through this cooperative contract, with a minimum of 225 new students added to the contract annually as new referrals from LAUSD to DOR. It is expected that each school year of the contract, 750 students will receive job exploration counseling, 750 students will receive workplace readiness training, 660 students will receive work-based learning instruction and experiences, 450 students will participate in a paid or unpaid work experience, 750 students will receive self-advocacy instruction, and 510 students will receive counseling on post-secondary educational programs. All services are considered “DOR Student Services” and are designed to improve future employment outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
 
Annual contract goals for individual DOR Districts are as follows:
 



 

       2025-2026

    2026-2027

     2027-2028



Los Angeles South Bay District

      21 students



Total # of Students   

             750

           750

         750


 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote, will authorize the Superintendent of Schools to implement this cooperative contract with the Department of Rehabilitation to provide DOR student services for identified students with disabilities in LAUSD schools for the period of July 2025-June 2028. And the Budget Services and Financial Planning Division will be authorized to include position and expenditure authority in the Superintendent’s 2025-2028 Final Budgets in the amount of $1,357,244 annually in order to implement the project described in this report.
 
A ”No” vote, will end the Transition Partnership Program contract with the Department of Rehabilitation for 2025-2028 to provide services and work-based learning for LAUSD students with disabilities.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Department of Rehabilitation will fund the District for staffing costs and approved services and operating expenses of $1,357,244 annually for the 2025-2028 school years. 
 
For students participating in paid work experience, the Department of Rehabilitation subsidizes the cost of student wages and benefits, through individual authorizations after students complete an intake process with the Department of Rehabilitation.
 
Student Impact:
Across all age groups, persons with disabilities are much less likely to be employed than those with no disabilities (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, February 2024). The National Technical Assistance Center on Transition indicates that paid employment/work experience, self-determination, and self-advocacy are research-based practices correlated with future student employment success. Additionally, career awareness and interagency collaboration are recognized as promising practices. This ongoing partnership between Los Angeles Unified School District and the Department of Rehabilitation provides services and paid work-based learning experiences for students with disabilities to prepare them for future employment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Equity Impact:

Brief Description:
description
(2024-25 Second Interim Report and Multi-Year Projections) Recommends approval of the 2024-25 Second Interim Financial Report with a positive certification, confirming the District can meet its financial obligations through the next two years to maintain financial stability and uninterrupted support to student services.
 
As required by Education Code Sections 42130 and 42131, this report ensures compliance and transparency in the District’s financial health. Upon approval, it will be submitted to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS) for review. A non-positive certification would trigger additional oversight and restrictions.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approval of the 2024-25 Second Interim Financial Report, which contains a “positive” certification (enclosed herewith as “Attachment A”). In addition, approval to submit the Second Interim Report to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).
end
 
Body
Background: 
Under Education Code (EC) Section 42130, the superintendent of each school district is required to submit two reports to the governing board of the district during each fiscal year. The first and second reports shall cover the financial and budgetary status of the district for the periods ending October 31 and January 31 (“First and Second Interim” reports, respectively). Both reports shall be approved by the district’s governing board no later than 45 days after the close of the period being reported. In addition, EC section 42131 requires the Board to certify to CSS, the State Controller, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction whether the district is able to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year and, based on the current forecast for the next two fiscal years, using one of three certification scenarios:
•                     A positive certification indicates that based on current projections, the district will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and two subsequent years.
•                     A qualified certification indicates that the district may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or two subsequent fiscal years.
•                     A negative certification indicates that the district will not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon adoption by the Governing Board (Board) of the Los Angeles Unified School District (District), the District files the Second Interim Report with CSS to be in compliance with EC requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may accept the staff’s determination of a positive condition or approve the report with a modification in the projections.
 
Los Angeles County of Education (LACOE) shall review the District’s certification. It has the authority and responsibility to change the certification if it determines that the District’s certification was not appropriate. 
 
In the event the District’s certification is other than positive at the second interim period, it must provide an additional report of financial statement projections of fund and cash balance no later than June 1st. This is known as the “Third Interim Report,” which does not require Board certification. Further, it may not, in that fiscal year or the next fiscal year, issue non-voter approved debt unless the County Superintendent determines that the District shall probably make repayment of such debt issuance. LACOE may also impose various restrictions on districts that fail to deal with financial issues raised in interim reports. Finally, rating agencies may consider interim reports when evaluating or revising credit ratings.
 
Policy Implications: 
Submission of the District’s 2024-25 Second Interim Financial Report shall comply with Education Code and LACOE requirements.
 
Budget Impact: 
This report maintains reserves at the required statutory level.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code ensures that the District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.
 
Equity Impact:

Score Rationale



Recognition

     3

District budgeting ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities.”  While some allocations of resources are district-wide, some investments such as Student Equity Need Index recognize historical inequities.



Resource Prioritization

     3

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.



Results

     3

Resources are allocated to the extent that it would support student needs, address priorities of achieving the District Strategic Plan.

Brief Description:
(Certification of Measure US Results and Establishment of a Separate Capital Projects Fund) Recommends approval of the certification of the November 5, 2024, Election results for Measure US and authorize the establishment of a new Capital Projects fund and budget for Fiscal Year 2024-25
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Approve the attached resolution (Attachment A) certifying the November 5, 2024, Measure US election results; and 
2)                     Authorize the establishment of a separate Capital Projects fund; and 
3)                     Authorize a budget of $500 million in the Fiscal Year 2024-25 for the newly created fund, for Measure US planning activities and/or capital projects that are anticipated to be presented to the Board of Education between now and June 30, 2025. 
 
Body
Background: 
On November 5, 2024, voters authorized Measure US, $9 billion local school bond measure, with 68.02% of the votes cast in support. Measure US will provide funds to replace aging and deteriorating school facilities, including school technology infrastructure and equipment; provide safe, resilient, and up-to-date facilities; enhance accessibility; enhance and expand outdoor spaces and student food services; promote energy efficiency; and right-size school facilities. As required by Education Code 15274 and/or 15124, the Board of Education (Board) shall certify election results and proceedings to the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt staff’s proposal which will permit the future issuance of bond proceeds.  Approval will also result in Measure US activities being accounted for in the District Bond Fund within the District’s accounting and financial systems and reported in the Annual Audited Financial Report (AAFR) and the Unaudited Actual Financial Reports to the California Department of Education. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board adopts the proposed actions, the election results for the local bond measure, Measure US, will be certified as required by Education Code 15274 and/or 15124, a new fund will be officially established, and a $500 million budget authority will be established for the Measure US fund.
 
If the Board does not adopt the proposal in its entirety, the requirements of Education Code 15274 and/or 15124 will not be met and may affect the District's ability to issue Measure US general obligation bonds. Furthermore, the District will also not be able to establish the new fund.  In addition, the Measure US planning activities and/or capital projects that are anticipated to be presented to the Board of Education between now and June 30, 2025, may be delayed and may ultimately delay the benefit to schools and students. 
 
Policy Implications: 
None. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The funds necessary for the $500 million budget authority in the Fiscal Year 2024-25, for Measure US planning activities and/or capital projects that are anticipated to be presented to the Board of Education between now and June 30, 2025, will be borrowed from other capital project fund(s) until bonds are issued.  There is no impact to the General Fund.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code ensures the District will continue to operate and serve its student population.  Moreover, this action will provide a budget to support planning activities and/or capital projects that will upgrade and/or replace school facilities to improve safety, resiliency, accessibility, energy efficiency, school technology, and outdoor spaces throughout Los Angeles Unified. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The Board’s adoption of this proposal will certify the Measure US election results as required by Education Code 15274 and/or 15124. The issuance of bonds will be presented in a separate report for consideration by the Board. Staff expects to present such a proposal to the Board later this year to authorize the issuance of Measure US bonds in fiscal year 2024-25. The initial $500 million budget may require an interfund borrowing from other capital project funds, which will be reimbursed once Measure US bonds are issued, and proceeds are made available.

(Align Funding Strategies for Three School Facilities Projects/Programs Funded by Certificates of Participation (COPs 2023 Series A) with the School Upgrade Program Framework and Measure US Priorities and Implementation Strategies) Recommends approval of the following actions to align funding strategies for three school facilities projects/programs funded by 2023 Series A Certificates of Participation (2023 COP) proceeds with the School Upgrade Program framework and Measure US priorities and implementation strategies.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the following actions to align funding strategies for three school facilities projects/programs funded by 2023 COPs proceeds with the School Upgrade Program framework and Measure US priorities and implementation strategies:
 
1.                     Approve up-to $250,000,000 in direct reallocations from three School Upgrade Program categories (Measure US proceeds specifically) of capital need to defease a portion of the 2023 COPs associated with three school facilities projects, as shown in Exhibit A (Updated School Upgrade Program).  
 
2.                     Approve the allocation of $251,880,057¹ of 2023 COPs proceeds into the School Upgrade Program, as shown in Exhibit A, to fund the underlying scope of the three school facilities projects.
 
3.                     Approve Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) amendments (Information Technology Services (ITS), Transportation Services Division (Transportation) and Facilities Services Division (Facilities)) to incorporate the three projects, Campus Safety Systems Improvements Program (Phase 1- 291 sites), Sun Valley electric school buses (180 buses), and Green Schoolyard Upgrade projects (15 projects), therein, as shown in Exhibit B, including allocating $17,827,000 of Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campus to fund construction activities for all 15 Green Schoolyard Upgrade projects.
 
 
______________________________
¹$251,880,057 represents the total COPs allocation for eligible project/program scope. It is more than the up-to $250,000,000 of direct reallocations for defeasance because debt service was paid in 2023-2024, thereby reducing the amount that can be defeased.  
 
4.                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer, the Chief Facilities Executive, the Chief Information Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On June 13, 2023, the Board authorized a resolution approving the execution and delivery of COPs in the not-to-exceed amount of $500,000,000 (Board Report No. 300-22/23).  In August 2023, the 2023 COPs were sold generating $423,500,000 to fund critical unmet needs of school support facilities and high-priority school facility needs for which sufficient bond funding was not available, in alignment with the Strategic Plan and Board of Education (Board) priorities. On December 12, 2023, the Board approved the use of $423,500,000 of  2023 COPs proceeds to fund all or a portion of nine high-priority Capital Plan projects and/or programs, to be undertaken at one or more sites (Board Report No. 024-23/24). 
 
Approximately one year after the 2023 COPs were sold, the Board authorized the placement of Measure US, a $9,000,000,000 local public schools safety and upgrades measure on the November 5, 2024, general election ballot (Board Report No. 029-24/25). Measure US contained an explicit provision (Part Three of the Bond Project List-Miscellaneous) that funds from the Measure could be used to defease the portion of 2023 COPs attributable to projects authorized to be financed under the Measure (i.e. bond eligible projects).  On November 5, 2024, voters authorized Measure US with 68.02% of the votes cast in support of the measure.
 
LA Unified is projected to meet its financial obligations in Fiscal Year 2025 and in the two subsequent fiscal years, and the Board will be requested to certify the District’s financial condition as “Positive” at second interim financial report.  However, to maintain a positive General Fund Unrestricted ending balance in the current three-year multi-year projection period, it is still anticipated that funds will need to be transferred from Local Reserve Fund 17 to the General Fund in FY26 and FY27, thereby reducing Local Reserves to 2% in FY27.  Moreover, the estimated Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) decrease in the Governor’s proposed 2025-26 budget proposal, from 2.93% to 2.43% is estimated to have a $29,000,000 impact on LA Unified in FY26. 
 
With the approval of Measure US and the worsening of economic and budget conditions, the 2023 COPs Capital Plan projects/programs were recently evaluated against the Measure US priorities and implementation plan. Three of the projects/programs were identified as aligning with the priorities and implementation strategies and the historic use of local bond proceeds: 
 
•                     Sun Valley Electric School Buses Project (180 buses)
•                     Green Schoolyard Upgrades (15 projects) 
•                     Campus Information Technology (IT) Safety Systems Improvements Program (Phase 1: 291 sites)
 
Over the next 14 years, the District is required to pay an estimated $504,000,000 in debt service on the 2023 COPs from the General Fund for all nine projects. $11,300,000 of debt service was included in the 2023-24 budget, and for subsequent years the estimated annual payment is $36,000,000. The next principal payment is due on October 1, 2025. Of the total estimated debt service, approximately $303,000,000 is attributable to the three bond eligible projects/programs listed above, with an estimated annual debt service of $21,600,000.
 
The proposal to align funding strategies for three school facilities projects/programs funded with 2023 COPs proceeds with the School Upgrade Program framework and Measure US priorities and implementation strategies is being made to provide relief to the General Fund.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on February 27, 2025.  Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the BOC, the District provided the BOC with the opportunity to consider the bond
funded proposal and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to approve or disapprove the proposal prior to presenting the item to the Board for final action. Following discussion, a vote was taken which resulted in 5 ayes, 4 nays, two abstentions, and two absences, as referenced in Exhibit C.  Having fulfilled the requirements under the MOU, the proposal will proceed to the Board without a BOC recommendation. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit D.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of four actions to align funding strategies for three school facilities projects/programs funded with 2023 COPs proceeds with the School Upgrade Program framework and Measure US priorities and implementation strategies. Actions include approval  of up to $250,000,000 in direct reallocations from Measure US to defease a portion of the 2023 COPs which are associated with three school facilities projects/programs: Sun Valley Electric School Buses Project, Green Schoolyard Upgrades (15 projects), and the Campus IT Safety Systems Improvements Program (Phase 1: 291 sites). 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board approves the recommendation, savings to the General Fund of $303,000,000 will be achieved. If the Board does not approve the recommended action, the savings will not be realized, and debt service will be paid through the General Fund. The estimated annual General Fund debt service for the three identified eligible projects/programs is $21,600,000.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is compliant with Section 4.08 of the District’s Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
Because the GO Bonds will refund a significant portion (approximately 59.5%) of the 2023 COPs, the District’s General Fund will be relieved of most of the debt service for the 2023 COPs. The identified projects will be funded with proceeds of the 2023 COPs and refinanced with bond proceeds, and debt service will be repaid by ad valorem property tax revenues, not the District’s General Fund revenues.  The refinancing, if approved, will achieve General Fund debt service savings of $303,000,000 over the next 14 years (approximately $21,600,000 per year and $65,000,000 over the next three years of the multi-year projection). There are seven projects funded by the 2023 COPs which are not included in this refunding proposal. The District will continue to pay debt service of nearly $207,000,000 from the General Fund for these projects.
 
The combined cost to defease the outstanding 2023 COPs associated with the three identified school facilities projects/programs is estimated to not-to-exceed $250,000,000. The defeasance will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program, specifically associated with Measure US, for the replacement of aging and outdated school buses ($75,000,000), IT infrastructure and system upgrades: comprehensive enhancements to school audio systems ($104,500,000) and IT Safety Upgrades: video camera systems to improve safety of campus infrastructure ($70,500,000).   If less than $250,000,000 is ultimately required to defease the applicable  portion of the 2023 COPs for eligible projects, the remaining funds will be returned to their respective ITS School Upgrade Program category of need.
 
The original combined budget for the Green Schoolyard Upgrades was estimated at $100,000,000 in December 2023. An initial funding allocation of $75,000,000 was provided, which was expected to provide sufficient funding to complete pre-construction activities at all 15 sites and construction at a minimum of 11 sites. The funding strategy consisted of $25,000,000 of 2023 COPs proceeds, an allocation of $50,000,000 of Restricted General Fund-Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P) funds, and a future allocation of $25,000,000 to complete all the projects.
 
In aligning these 15 projects with the School Upgrade Program framework and Measure US priorities and implementation strategies, the combined total project budget is being updated to $92,827,000 to reflect current information known, and assumptions about the project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the projects.  
 
Additionally, $17,827,000 of bond program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses is being allocated to fund construction activities for all 15 projects.  Facilities staff, in collaboration with the Division of Instruction and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, will continue to assess opportunities to leverage ELO-P entitlements on an annual basis to support these 15 Green Schoolyard Upgrade Projects.  If ultimately there is an insufficient amount of ELO-P funds available, additional bond program funds will be allocated to complete these 15 projects. 
 
Student Impact:
The proposal to defease a portion of the 2023 COPs with Measure US proceeds will provide General Fund relief by reducing General Fund debt service costs, thereby improving the position of the District’s General Fund over the current three-year multi-year projection period.
 
Equity Impact:
N/A
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The District is facing fiscal pressure on its operating funds due to a variety of factors including declining enrollment, expiration of ESSER funding, and the devastating wildfires. Defeasing a portion of the 2023 COPs for eligible projects now will save the General Fund $303,000,000. However, if the District waits until 2033 when the longest-term debts can be paid off (maturities can be called), the savings to the General Fund would decline at the rate of $21,600,000 per year for seven years ($152,000,000 in total). 
 
The cash from the original 2023 COPs proceeds will continue to be spent on the projects originally approved in 2023, and Measure US bond proceeds will be placed in an escrow account and used to pay the annual debt service on up-to $250,000,000 of eligible 2023 COPs until 2033 when the bonds can be called. The 2023 COPs proceeds will be incorporated into the ITS, Transportation, and Facilities SEPs to support project/program implementation.  Project/program expenditures and schedule updates will be reported in the same manner as bond funded projects. 
 
As noted earlier, refinancing a portion of the 2023 COPs necessitates the reallocation of Measure US spending targets within the School Upgrade Program. The strategy proposed maintains funding for school greening and building resiliency projects, however it reduces funding targeted for school information technology improvements and the replacement of aging/outdated school buses (as shown in Exhibit A). 
 
Based on preliminary assessments, the reallocation is anticipated to impact future plans for school audio systems and video camera systems with Measure US funds as follows: 
 
•                     School Audio Enhancements: Under the original Measure US spending target of $521,000,000, 547 school sites were anticipated to be upgraded with updated school audio systems, including integrated and enhanced school internet protocol (IP) - public address speakers, IP-based master clocks, audio enhancement systems, such as classroom speakers for instruction, and mass notification systems. After the proposed reallocation, audio systems at 396 school sites are expected to be upgraded with the $416,500,000 updated spending target.   The outstanding need for upgraded school audio systems will remain at 323 school sites until additional funding is identified.  
 
•                     Campus Safety Systems Upgrades (Phase 2B): Projects to modernize school technology safety systems consisting of video and intrusion alarm systems are underway at 321 school sites utilizing bond (30 sites) and 2023 COPs (291 sites) proceeds. These video camera and intrusion alarm systems (separate from secure entry projects) serve as a deterrent to potential offenders and assist with property protection. Under the original Measure US spending target of $70,500,000, video and intrusion alarm system installations at an additional 231 sites were anticipated to be undertaken.  With the reallocation, no new funding will be targeted and the outstanding need for campus technology safety systems upgrades will remain at 398 school sites until additional funding is identified.  
 
If the $75,000,000 targeted to replace aging and outdated school buses is redirected to defease eligible 2023 COPs, the Transportation Services Division will continue to aggressively pursue grant opportunities for electric school buses, for which there are many opportunities. Currently, there are 108 electric school buses on hand, 143 pending delivery, and recent grant awards for an additional 224.  Approximately 900 aging buses remain to be replaced. Due to grant restrictions, the Measure US funding targeted for school buses could not have been used as a local match for a grant.

Brief Description:
(Authorization of a Resolution of the Board of Education Approving the Sale and Issuance of Not-to-Exceed $400,000,000 of General Obligation Refunding Bonds and the Forms of the Documents Necessary for the Issuance of such Refunding Bonds) Recommends approval for the issuance of up to $400 million in General Obligation Refunding Bonds and approval of the necessary documents like a Bond Purchase Agreement, Continuing Disclosure Certificate, Escrow Agreement, and Official Statement. The sale of the GO Refunding Bonds will be through a negotiated method considering market conditions, declining enrollment, and budget uncertainties. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the attached Refunding Resolution for General Obligation Bonds (the “Refunding General Obligation Bonds Resolution”) (Attachment A) in connection with the issuance of the General Obligation Refunding Bonds (the “GO Refunding Bonds”) which will:
a.                     Authorize the issuance of not to exceed $400,000,000 of aggregate GO Refunding Bonds;
 
b.                     Approve the forms of documents necessary for the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds, including a Bond Purchase Agreement, a Continuing Disclosure Certificate, Escrow Agreement and an Official Statement (Attachments B - E);
 
c.                     Authorize the sale of the GO Refunding Bonds by negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility afforded by this method, and the ability to include a retail order period and meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes; and
 
d.                     Approve and direct certain actions to be taken in connection with the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds.
end
 
Body
Background:
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the General Obligation Refunding Bonds Resolution, which is a resolution for the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds in an amount not-to-exceed $400,000,000, as contemplated in the District’s Master Refunding Resolution for Fiscal Year 2024-25. The Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Director of Capital Planning and Budgeting are authorized to effect the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions. 
 
 
While the District typically issues refunding bonds on a tax-exempt basis, it is possible that either tax-exempt or taxable refunding structures may generate significant savings to justify an economic refunding.  As a result, the Master Refunding Resolution and General Obligation Refunding Bonds Resolution provide the flexibility to issue the GO Refunding Bonds on either a tax-exempt or taxable basis if circumstances arise that favor one or the other structure, and authorize the forms of documents necessary to issue the GO Refunding Bonds.  
 
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, as determined by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Master Refunding Resolution and General Obligation Refunding Bonds Resolution also authorizes the sale of the GO Refunding Bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility provided, and the ability to include a retail order period and provide meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. Finance, in accordance with the procedures established in the Debt Management Policy, has completed the process of selecting certain members of the financing team from the respective legal counsel and municipal advisor benches. The financing team for the upcoming transaction will include Best Best & Krieger LLP, as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel, and KNN Public Finance, LLC, as Municipal Advisor. In addition, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association will serve as agent of the County Treasurer, as Paying Agent.  The Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager (s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.
 
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1, the Board of Education has obtained from KNN Public Finance, LLC, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance and good faith estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the General Obligation Refunding Bonds Resolution.
 
The GO Refunding Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the General Obligation Refunding Bonds Resolution will enable the District to enter the market in an expedited manner to reduce the debt service costs on a portion of the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds should market conditions support a refunding.
 
Board Options and Consequences:
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds which, subject to favorable market conditions, may generate taxpayer savings through a refunding.
 
Policy Implications:
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and, Article 4 Sections 4.08 and 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact:
The proceeds of the GO Refunding Bonds will be placed into an escrow account and used to defease and call (prepay) the refunded bonds. Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. There will be no impact on the District’s General Fund.
 
Student Impact:
The issuance of GO Refunding Bonds will reduce the taxes needed to repay the debt service on the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds and create more capacity to issue general obligation bonds in the future for new projects.
 
Equity Impact:
 



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

     3

Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. Communities that have experienced historical inequities should benefit from reduced property taxes.



Resource Prioritization

     4

Savings achieved through the refunding of outstanding bonds benefit the District and its taxpayers through reduced debt service and property tax levies, respectively. This relief allows resources that would otherwise be used to service debt and property taxes, to be used for student needs.  



Results

     2

The refunding of bonds is done to achieve debt service savings and reduce ad valorem property taxes. It may result in closing achievement gaps by increasing disposable income in households located within communities that have experienced historical inequities, giving them the ability to allocate resources towards the education of their children (students).

Issues and Analysis: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of a resolution for general obligation refunding bonds in an amount not-to-exceed $400,000,000, based on the total amount of callable bonds outstanding.  The GO Refunding Bonds are expected to be issued in Spring 2025.

Body
Background: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution, which is a resolution that authorizes the issuance of up to $700,000,000 of GO Bonds under Measure US  to finance and refinance projects authorized under Measure US and the form of documents necessary to issue the GO Bonds.  In addition to financing new capital projects, a portion of the GO Bonds will be issued to refund a portion of the District’s 2023 Certificates of Participation attributable to Measure US projects (the “2023 COPs”). The General Obligation Bonds Resolution authorizes the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Director of Capital Planning and Budgeting to effect the issuance of the GO Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions.  In addition, consistent with the District’s practice for prior GO Bonds, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution provides for a request to the Board of Supervisors of the County to adopt a corresponding resolution providing for the issuance of the GO Bonds pursuant to the Education Code. The GO Bonds are currently expected to be sold in Spring 2025.
 
The portion of GO Bonds issued to refund the 2023 COPs will be issued on a taxable basis due to the restrictions of federal tax law.  As a result, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution provides the flexibility to issue the GO Bonds on either a tax-exempt or taxable basis, in one or more series.
 
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, as determined by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution also authorizes the sale of the GO Bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility provided, and the ability to include a retail order period and provide meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. Finance, in accordance with the procedures established in the Debt Management Policy, has completed the process of selecting certain members of the financing team from the respective legal counsel and municipal advisor benches. The financing team for the upcoming transaction will include Best Best & Krieger LLP, as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel, and KNN Public Finance, LLC, as Municipal Advisor.  In addition, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association will serve as agent of the County Treasurer, as Paying Agent. The Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager(s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.
 
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1 and Education Code Section 15146, the Board of Education has obtained from KNN Public Finance, LLC, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance and good faith estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution.
 
The GO Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law and as authorized by voters within the District pursuant to Measure US.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the issuance of the GO Bonds will enable the District to enter the market to finance approved capital projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of GO Bonds to finance approved capital projects. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and Article 4 Section 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
Because a portion of the issuance of GO Bonds will refund a large portion (approximately 59.5%) of the 2023 COPs, the District’s general fund will be relieved of a large portion of the debt service for the 2023 COPs. The identified projects will be funded with proceeds of the 2023 COPs and refinanced with bond proceeds, and debt service will be repaid by ad valorem property tax revenues, not the District’s general fund revenues.
 
Student Impact: 
The issuance of the GO Bonds will improve the District’s capital facilities and information technology resources for the benefit of the students.
 
Equity Impact:

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 24 Classroom Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 24 Classroom Upgrade Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein for a combined budget of $209,896,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 24 Classroom Upgrade Projects (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $209,896,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework. The updated SUP framework and the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. The Implementation Plan included, among other priorities, the development of projects to provide upgrades focused on the interior of existing classroom spaces.
 
The school sites identified for the proposed Projects were deemed to have the highest need for classroom upgrades based on their overall Facilities Condition Index (FCI) score for interior classroom spaces. FCI scores indicate the remaining service life of the physical components within classroom spaces and as compared to other schools. Additionally, the priority for implementation of the proposed Projects focused on middle school programs with the goal of attracting and retaining students transitioning from elementary to secondary education across the District’s four geographic Regions. 
 
The proposed Projects will provide upgrades to classrooms utilized for instruction, special education, and school set-asides within permanent and relocatable buildings. Each classroom within a school site has unique conditions and will be surveyed to understand deficiencies needing to be addressed. Based on the individual needs of each classroom, the scope may include upgrades to technology, electrical upgrades to support new classroom technology, white boards, tack boards, window blinds, paint, and security locks. The Projects also include providing new classroom furniture, replacing damaged ceiling tiles, and other upgrades required to comply with local, state, and federal requirements. 
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on February 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified School District’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the 24 proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the design and construction of the proposed Projects.
 
The upgraded classrooms, once completed, will provide facilities that support education programs and student achievement. The proposed Projects will also decrease demands for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds and begin the environmental reviews and clearances, design, procurement, construction, and other activities necessary to implement the proposed Projects. 
 
If the proposal is not approved, the Projects will not commence, and the schools will not benefit from the upgrades being proposed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. It furthers implementation of the update to the SUP to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework. Furthermore, the proposal is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in the District's local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading classrooms at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined Project budget for the 24 proposed Projects is $209,896,000. The Projects will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.
 
The budgets for the proposed Projects at Sutter Middle School, Le Conte Middle School and Wright STEAM Magnet Middle School include $8,651,000 for classrooms presently occupied by co-located charter schools pursuant to Education Code section 47614 (Proposition 39). Bond Program funds targeted for Charter School Facilities Upgrades and Expansions will be transferred to funds earmarked in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses, and all aspects of the proposed upgrades will be owned entirely by the District.
 
The Project budgets were prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed Project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Projects. 
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects, once completed, will help ensure approximately 20,700 current and future students attending these 24 schools are provided with safe, welcoming, and state-of-the-art learning environments that support student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. The proposed Projects will also allow schools to attract and retain future students, which builds school pride and enhances opportunities to create a positive school culture.
 
Equity Impact:
School sites represent all four Regions (North, East, South, and West) and were prioritized based on their Facilities Condition Index scores. This approach is intended to systematically upgrade over 2,000 classrooms across approximately 48 middle schools, with an investment of $350 million, ensuring that 12 middle schools in each Region receive upgrades. 
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff will implement all opportunities to minimize construction impacts on school operations and existing education programs. As necessary, the temporary use of unused classrooms, off-hour construction and other opportunities will be utilized to reduce impacts to the existing education programs at each school.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Body
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework and approved the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) to help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. The Implementation Plan included, among other things, the development of playground and campus exterior upgrade projects within the category of need for Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components. These proposed Projects will address the most deteriorated paving conditions and transform playground areas.
 
The proposed Projects may include, but are not limited to, greening and landscaping improvements throughout the campus in alignment with the District’s Green Schoolyards for All Plan (April 2024), paving replacement in playgrounds and other areas, solar reflective coating in playgrounds, privacy fencing where needed, exterior painting of all buildings and structures, and accessibility upgrades, as described in Exhibit A.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on February 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt this proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the seven proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and playground and campus exterior upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing playground and campus exterior upgrades at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined budget for the seven proposed Projects is $101,976,292. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed Project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to improve facilities that help ensure the approximately 3,510 current and future students attending these seven schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities Condition Assessment data identified schools with the worst paving condition based on age, aesthetics, deterioration, health and safety concerns, and weighting factors for paving condition and the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index was applied to achieve an equitable distribution to prioritize schools with the highest enrollment across the District for development of a proposed Project.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on February 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the schools and their students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the four proposed projects is $203,736. Three projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. One project is funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 820 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Four Charter School Facilities Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends the definition and approval of four projects to provide upgrades for Los Angeles Unified School District facilities currently occupied by charter schools and amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein for a total combined budget of $73,003,621.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve four projects to provide upgrades for Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) facilities currently occupied by charter schools, as detailed in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed projects is $73,003,621.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - supports the development of projects that upgrade, modernize, and replace aging and deteriorating school facilities, update technology, and address facilities inequities to help improve student health, safety, and educational quality. The SUP includes a spending target entitled “Charter School Facilities Upgrades and Expansions.” Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP.
 
Charter school facilities upgrade projects developed under this category of need are subject to assessment of the conditions and needs of the school building/site systems and components of District facilities occupied by charter schools, input from the charter school community, and development of an implementation plan by District staff.
 
The proposals contained in Exhibit A of this Board Report include projects to replace heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems at Animo Legacy Charter Middle School and Pacoima Charter Elementary School, a project to provide a secure entry system at Para Los Niños Charter Middle School, and a project to replace fencing and a gravity wall at Santa Monica Community Charter Elementary School.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on February 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve four projects to provide upgrades at District facilities currently occupied by charter schools. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the project proposals in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and the school site system needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading charter school facilities. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the four projects is $73,003,621 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to improve facilities that help ensure the approximately 2,720 current and future students attending these four schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Community Magnet Charter Elementary) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Community Magnet Charter Elementary, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 447 students in grades K-5 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Community Magnet Charter Elementary (“Charter School”), located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 447 students in grades K-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Community Magnet Charter Elementary is a K-5 school currently serving 426 students on a District site at 11301 Bellagio Road, Los Angeles, CA, 90049 in Board District 4 and Region West. Community Magnet Charter Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on August 28, 2007.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 519 students in grades K-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Community Magnet Charter Elementary expires June 30, 2025.
 
On December 11, 2024, Community Magnet Charter Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through March 11, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on January 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.
 
 “No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 222, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Community Magnet Charter Elementary is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 223, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Justice Street Academy Charter is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Center for Advanced Learning) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Center for Advanced Learning, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve up to 321 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Center for Advanced Learning (“Charter School”), located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2030, to serve up to 321 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  The school’s renewal petition includes a reduction of enrollment capacity from 360 to 321.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Center for Advanced Learning is a TK-5 school currently serving 236 students on a private facility at 4016 S. Central Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90011 in Board District 5 and Region East. Center for Advanced Learning was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on May 22, 2007.  On December 13, 2016, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 360 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Center for Advanced Learning expires June 30, 2025.
 
On December 12, 2024, Center for Advanced Learning submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through March 12, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on January 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Center for Advanced Learning’s governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader, and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 224, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for PUENTE Charter) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for PUENTE Charter, located in Board District 2 and Region East, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 360 students in grades TK-5 by the end of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for PUENTE Charter (“Charter School”), located in Board District 2 and Region East, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve 320 students in grades TK-5 in year one, and up to 360 students in grades TK-5 by the end of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report. 
 
Consistent with Charter School’s enrollment plan identified in its operative charter, the approved 2018 material revision to expand grade levels to TK-5 and increase enrollment, and Charter School’s previously stated intent to serve 360 students during the next renewal term, Charter School seeks to increase its current enrollment capacity from 300 students to 360 students, which staff reviewed considering prior action.

Body
Background: 
PUENTE Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 299 students on a private facility at 501 S. Boyle Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90033 in Board District 2 and Region East. PUENTE Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on May 14, 2002.  On March 14, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 100 students in Kindergarten.  On April 3, 2018, the charter school’s material revision request was approved to expand grade levels from Kindergarten to TK-5 for a total enrollment of 300 students by the end of the charter term. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for PUENTE Charter expires June 30, 2025.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a no vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  A no vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
Policy Implications:

Brief Description:
(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 9 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 9 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new Art, English, Special Education, Science, and Multiple Subject teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as Art, English, Special Education, Science, and Multiple Subject where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Brief Description:
(2024-2025 Nonpublic School/Agency (“NPS/A”) Approval of Master Contracts) Recommends the ratification of the 2024-2025 Nonpublic School/Agency (“NPS/A”) Master Contracts.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Division of Special Education within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A”: Nonpublic School/Agency (“NPS/A”) Master Contracts (exceeding $250,000) for the 2024- 2025 school year. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Division of Special Education prepares periodic reports for contract actions necessary for the provision of special education and related services in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) requires that the District provide qualified students with disabilities with special education and related services. The District meets these obligations through its Special Education Local Plan Area (“SELPA”) Local Plan. The District is required to maintain a continuum of program options, including non-public, nonsectarian schools and nonpublic agencies, to meet the needs of its special education students. (Ed. Code, §§ 56360, 56361, 56365.)
 
The District is required to make available NPS and NPA services and must provide these services by entering into a master contract for non-public, nonsectarian school or agency services. The master contract must specify the financial agreement between the District and NPS/A for the services in a student’s IEP that the NPS/A will provide. (Ed. Code, § 56366(a).) The District negotiates its master contracts with NPS/As on an annual basis. (Title 5 C.C.R. § 3062(a).)
 
The Division of Special Education is seeking Board ratification of Nonpublic School/Agency Master Contracts for the 2024-25 school year, as provided for in Attachment “A”, for the provision of statutorily required Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) supports and services. These contracts are within the authority previously delegated in Board action taken on June 4, 2024 (Board Report No. 302 - 23/24).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the Division of Special Education to continue the provision of special education supports and services provided by these contracts to the Los Angeles Unified School District to serve eligible students with disabilities in support of Board policies and goals.
 
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote ratifies the Division of Special Education’s executed Master Contracts that provide NPS/A services to qualified students with disabilities. 
 
A “NO” vote will result in immediate unavailability of these services or discontinuance of services, or both. The unavailability or discontinuance of these services would likely result in costly litigation and increased future costs in securing these services. Postponement of actions presented for ratification in Attachment “A” will delay contract award or delivery dates, resulting in costly litigation. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to Board action on June 4, 2024 (Board Report No. 302 - 23/24).
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.
 
Student Impact:
These contracts support the provision of special education and related services required by federal and state special education laws. 
 
Equity Impact:

Brief Description:
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” include the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; Good and General Services: District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Good and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000): New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract as listed on Attachment “B.”

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts, Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; Good and General Services:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts, Contract Amendments; and Good and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the project approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District Costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board, approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; and 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; and 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts

Whereas, Ramadan is the ninth and holiest month of the Islamic calendar; 
Whereas, Ramadan holds profound significance for Muslims worldwide, emphasizing fasting, prayer and charity;  
 
Whereas, Ramadan will begin on February 28, 2025 and end on March 28 or March 29, 2025; 
 
Whereas, Ramadan serves as a catalyst for personal growth, spiritual growth, community connection and giving back;
 
Whereas, Muslim students who observe Ramadan will be abstaining from drinking water or eating food during daylight hours;  
 
Whereas, Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to inclusivity and support for all faiths within our vibrant school community, fostering an environment of mutual respect, understanding, and solidarity; and 
 
Whereas, The District is committed to support the well-being of their students while providing a safe environment that allows students to practice their faith freely; now, therefore, be it;
 
Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District will send a yearly bulletin to staff and to families every year prior to the beginning of Ramadan to clarify our commitment to those who choose to observe Ramadan; and, be it finally;
 
Resolved That the bulletin will include suggestions for how schools can support students who observe Ramadan, including: 
 
•                     Identifying and providing a comfortable space for Muslim students to go instead of the dedicated lunchroom;
•                     Providing alternative activities during lunch or allow students to rest or read;
•                     Providing fasting student athletes the option of lighter activities or allow for occasional breaks;
•                     Offering supper to fasting Muslim students so they may take their meals with them at the conclusion of school;
•                     Looking for opportunities to provide a brief lesson about Ramadan to promote inclusivity and understanding;
•                     Working with educators and staff to offer necessary flexibility for Muslim students and families who request to be excused from school for the Eid al Fitr holiday (The celebratory culmination of Ramadan which is expected to be celebrated on 3/28/2025 or 3/29/2025);
•                     Striving for enhanced communication among parents/guardians, teachers, and students/athletes to monitor, adapt, and address the student's needs during this period.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, Cesar E. Chavez was a true American hero, and the anniversary of his birth on March
31, 2020 provides a fitting opportunity to remember and honor his many contributions to social
justice and equity;
 
Whereas, In 1962 Cesar E. Chavez cofounded the United Farm Workers Union to contest poor
treatment of workers in the fields, and sought to empower those workers by organizing the first
union to acquire labor contracts for farm workers in the grape fields;
 
Whereas, Cesar E. Chavez changed the attitudes of workers in the fields, and the nation far
beyond, by leading them to live the La Causa slogan, “Si Se Puede”, by empowering all to fight
for civil rights and to strive for justice for all minorities;
 
Whereas, For more than three decades, Cesar E. Chavez led this groundbreaking organization by
effecting social change through peaceful tactics such as fasts, boycotts, strikes, and pilgrimages;
his union’s efforts influenced and inspired millions of Americans, forging a diverse national
coalition of students, middle-class consumers, religious groups, and minorities in a hard-won
struggle to achieve fair wages, medical coverage, pension benefits, humane living conditions,
and perhaps most important, dignity and respect for the hundreds of thousands of farmworkers
across the country;
 
Whereas, Cesar E. Chavez believed that it is not enough to teach our young people to be
successful, to seek achievement, and to make progress as individuals while forgetting about
progress and prosperity for their community and while leaving friends and neighbors behind; he
believed that our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others;
 
Whereas, In 2000, the California Senate established March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day, a
statewide holiday in recognition of the life of this outstanding Mexican-American labor leader
and the contributions he has made;
 
Whereas, The Cesar E. Chavez Day of Service and Learning was created for public school
children to promote service to the communities of California in honor of the life and work of
Cesar E. Chavez;
 
Whereas, An array of American streets, schools and even a national monument are named after
Cesar E. Chavez, including the United States Naval Ship Cesar E. Chavez which debuted in
2011;
 
Whereas, Even after his death in 1993, his message of non-violence, unity, and justice of all
people continues on today; and
 
Whereas, In 2014 President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day in the United States, with Americans being urged to “observe this day with appropriate service,
community, and educational programs to honor Cesar E. Chavez’s enduring legacy”; now,
therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District celebrates
March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day to honor his legacy and will observe it on March 31, 2025; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District will provide curriculum and resources aligned with the Cesar Chavez Foundation, ensuring students have access to educational materials that highlight the historical and ongoing impact of Cesar E.

Resolved, That the Superintendent encourages students, staff, school administrators, teachers, and community members to honor Cesar Chavez’s legacy through civic engagement activities, such as by attending the annual Cesar Chavez Day March for Justice in Pacoima on March 30, 2025, the East Los Angeles Library César Chávez celebration on March 19, 2025, and the Cesar Chávez Family Day at the LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes on March 23, 2025, and through implementation of service-learning projects and other educational opportunities based on his life, work, and values, and realizing the full intent of the State-established Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, Our nation’s public schools serve an essential purpose and role in providing a free education to all children, creating a healthy and supportive environment for students, and preparing those enrolled to be successful and productive members of society; 
 
Whereas, Providing federal funding for our nation’s children and the elementary and secondary schools that serve them is one of the most important functions of Congress; 
 
Whereas, The federal funding provided by Congress targets our nation’s most vulnerable children to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to learn, thrive, and reach their full potential; 
 
Whereas, Many of the core federal programs that provide funding to support our most vulnerable students and local public schools are administered and overseen by the U.S. Department of Education, an agency which the Trump administration reportedly intends to drastically overhaul and ultimately dismantle through a forthcoming Executive Order;
 
Whereas, Our public schools rely on the federal funding we receive to provide vital and essential educational, nutritional, and basic health services to all students, particularly those with the greatest needs, including students from low-income families, English language learners, and students with disabilities; 
 
Whereas, Federal Medicaid funding plays a crucial role in supporting our public schools and the well-being of our children by assisting with a portion of the cost of providing basic health services to eligible children from low-income families and assisting with the cost of providing education-related services like speech therapy and physical therapy for eligible students with disabilities; 
 
Whereas, Federal Child Nutrition Programs provide reimbursements to school districts for serving nutritious meals in schools and ensuring all children are ready to learn; 
 
Whereas, Federal funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA) helps school districts provide essential instructional services, including Title I grants to help low-income students and schools in the poorest neighborhoods, Title II grants to address teacher shortages and pay for teacher training, and Title III grants to help students learn English; 
 
Whereas, Congressional leaders are considering block granting federal education funding, a practice which historically has been used to reduce federal investments in education, cut funding to beneficiaries, and eliminate targeting to vulnerable populations; 
 
Whereas, The loss of these federal funds would have an enormous impact on all of our nation’s elementary and secondary school students, particularly those from low-income families, English language learners, and students with disabilities who attend high-poverty schools that have historically been underfunded; and
 
Whereas, Budget negotiations over FY 2025 continue, with the U.S Senate and House of Representatives approving budget resolutions in the most recent steps toward passing a final FY 2025 spending bill, where the full breadth and depth of funding cuts to federal programs meant to support vulnerable students is not yet known but likely to be significant and detrimental; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District (District) opposes education cuts in the FY 2025 spending bill and any subsequent legislative, administrative, or regulatory actions that would reduce funding for TK-12 schools, early childhood education, adult education; and, 
 
Resolved further. That the District opposes the ongoing weaponization of the Department of Education to advance harmful politically motivated aims, undermining the agency’s central role in protecting student civil rights, particularly the rights of students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students, immigrant students, and students that are socio-economically disadvantaged, or have historically faced racial discrimination; and be it finally, 
 
Resolved, That the District calls on members of the U.S. Congress to vote NO on any measure that includes: 
 
•                     Cuts to Medicaid that will negatively impact basic health and educational services for low-income children and students with disabilities; 
•                     Changes to restrict school meal eligibility under the Child Nutrition Programs; 
•                     Reductions in education funding for TK-12 programs including but not limited to Title I, Title II, and Title III of the ESEA, and funding for programs under the IDEA, Perkins Career Technical Education, Adult Education and Family Literacy, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and federal programs that provide early childhood education and care or;
•                     Block granting of education funding;
•                     Any action to overhaul or eliminate the Department of Education.",,,,,,,,

Body
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is dedicated to creating an equitable learning environment where every student has access to high-quality opportunities that foster success in post-secondary education, economic mobility, and lifelong achievement;
 
Whereas, The District’s 2022-26 Strategic Plan emphasizes college and career success, and the District has previously identified dual enrollment as a key strategy to achieve 100% graduation and college and career readiness, as demonstrated by initiatives like G.O. East L.A. (Res-006-21/22);
 
Whereas, In March 2024, the District and Los Angeles Community College District  (LACCD) has established a joint partnership to expand college and career pathways for all students in grades 9-12 and beyond through dual enrollment focused on College Credit Courses, CTE Pathways, Industry Certifications, Internships/Apprenticeships and the opportunity to earn an AA Degree;
 
Whereas, Dual enrollment improves student success by increasing college retention, completion rates, academic performance, and workforce readiness, while reducing financial barriers to postsecondary education and providing students with in-demand skills and improved access to high-growth sectors;
 
Whereas, The Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) reports that 81% of dual enrollment students enroll in a post-secondary institution within one year after high school graduation <https://www.ppic.org/?show-pdf=true&docraptor=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ppic.org%2Fpublication%2Fdual-enrollment-in-california%2F>, as well as higher rates of completing a college degree with an average increase of 25% <https://www.cccco.edu/-/media/CCCCO-Website/docs/report/CCCCO_CCAP_042721.pdf>;
 
Whereas, Dual enrollment programs are particularly effective in addressing opportunity gaps for Black and Latinx students, underscoring the need for expanded access;
 
Whereas, EdWorkingPaper research states that dual enrollment students have 4% to 9% higher annual earnings than compared to non-dual enrollment students <https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai25-1137.pdf>; and
 
Whereas, Collaborative partnerships including the District, LACCD Colleges: East Los Angeles College, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Harbor College, Los Angeles Mission College, Los Angeles Pierce College, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College, Los Angeles Southwest College, Los Angeles Valley College, West Los Angeles College, the California Community Foundation, and other key stakeholders share in this responsibility by supporting initiatives like the Annual Student Led Dual Enrollment Summit, year-round informational webinars, parent meetings, and students-led advocacy for increased access and equitable opportunities; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District designates from this point forward every April March as Dual Enrollment Awareness Month to raise awareness, encourage participation, and celebrate the accomplishments of students and institutions involved in these programs;
 
Resolved further, That during this month, schools, colleges, and community organizations are encouraged to engage in activities that highlight the benefits of dual enrollment, fostering a culture of academic excellence, career preparation, and lifelong learning;
 
Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to ensure all appropriate District staff promote dual enrollment programs through outreach, communications, and events in partnership with community colleges, universities, and external stakeholders; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to prepare and submit a report by December 2025 on the District’s dual enrollment programs, to establish a baseline assessment of student participation and success and 3-year goals. This report will analyzinge disaggregated data on student demographics, participation trends, college and career outcomes, and alignment with the District’s Strategic Plan goals for postsecondary success. The report should include recommendations to further enhance student participation and equity in dual enrollment programs.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to being the district of choice for families; 
 
Whereas, In 2017, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) unanimously passed Res-016-17/18, “TECH App: Transforming Engagement via Communication Hubs: Creating a New LAUSD App” which directed the District to create and maintain a District-wide smartphone app so that families could easily access, navigate, and provide meaningful input regarding information that is important to them in supporting their children’s academic success;
 
Whereas, The District uses the learning management system, Schoology, where students can monitor their grades and upload their assignments in a digital environment; and where parents can access their student’s grades, Individual Education Plans, and school announcements, complete magnet applications, and access other pertinent information about their students and schools through the parent portal, a digital platform;
 
Whereas, The District has started modernizing its systems. A recent Transportation modernization request for proposal sought “equipment and services to deliver modern systems to support operations of school buses and trucks of varying sizes.” And the District’s YumYummi application now allows parents and families to view daily, weekly, and monthly school meal offerings online. Departments across the District-including schools and offices-should utilize modern systems to support their operations;
 
Whereas, While the District has begun modernizing its processes, many District systems remain outdated and duplicative, often relying on hard copies, manual data entry, and antiquated processes. For example, families complete the same emergency contact information year after year, with no option to digitally submit pre-populated information from the previous year. These systems create frustrations for busy employees, parents, and community members; 
 
Whereas, Access to efficient and transparent online systems is especially important in 2025. We live in an increasingly digital world where you can order food online and pay with a mobile application, apply for a passport, and renew a driver's license or identification card. While the District has worked towards eliminating the digital divide, families do not have the option to make credit card payments online, utilize online booking systems, or complete annual enrollment forms online;
 
Whereas, Digitizing not only has positive environmental impacts due to the limited need for paper copies, but it also frees up schedules for other essential job functions and student support;
 
Whereas, Pillar 4D of the Strategic Plan focuses on operational effectiveness and includes updating processes and policies to strengthen student enrollment and academic success;
 
Whereas, The District has yet to digitize many internal systems and processes which causes delays and leads to frustration for families, community members, and staff. These outdated systems and processes include, but are not limited to:
 
•                     School enrollment;
•                     Emergency cards;
•                     Permission forms (i.e., field trip slips);
•                     Recording excused absences;
•                     Special Education reimbursement;
•                     Early Education Center payments;
•                     Leasing and civic center permits and payment;
•                     Transportation attendance and routes;
•                     Timesheet and mileage forms;
•                     Absence for illness and non-illness, family illness, and new child leave forms;
•                     TB Compliance forms;
•                     Cumulative records;
•                     Expanded learning sign-in and out forms
 
Whereas, The recent wildfires damaged thousands of hard copy cumulative records, emergency forms, and other critical documents that weren’t yet digitized; and
 
Whereas, The time it takes to process paper copies and physical receipts has put the District at risk for being out of compliance with mandated timelines; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified District (District) shall:
 
•                     Conduct an audit review of all its current systems and processes-both internal and external-to determine which can be digitized and modernized for ease of use and provide a report on the findings to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) within 60 120 days;
•                     Continue current efforts to fully digitize school enrollment forms, field trip permission slips, special education reimbursements, and leasing and civic center permits and payments by the end of 2025;
•                     Develop a plan outlining the feasibility, considerations, cost, timeline, and requirements for digitizeing and modernizeing the remaining processes listed above-and others identified in the audit review  by District departments-and eliminateing paper applications as the primary method for submission of documents and information for anything that is not expressly required by law by December June 30, 2025. While parents and guardians shall still have an option to complete forms via hard copies, digital systems and processes shall be prioritized by leveraging a Districtwide communications campaign;
•                     Conduct stakeholder and community feedback sessions by October 2025 with parents and guardians, District staff, and vendors and partners to gather input on modernization efforts;
•                     Fully implement the plan with all systems and processes digitized before by school year 2026-27, with quarterly updates to the Board until that process is complete.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, Community Schools are public schools that provide instruction, curriculum, services and support that fit each neighborhood’s needs, created and run by the people who know our children best; 
 
Whereas, The mission of the Los Angeles Unified School District Community Schools Initiative (CSI) is to improve student outcomes through addressing students’ academic, cognitive, physical, mental, and social-emotional needs. Needs of children and youth are met by building a positive school climate and trusting relationships, along with providing rich and rigorous learning opportunities that prepare all students to be ready for the world; 
 
Whereas, To fulfill these purposes, Community Schools must have the time and space for creative and collaborative problem-solving, and each local school community must be engaged authentically in the governance of their local school;
 
Whereas, Pilot schools are teacher-designed and -led District schools that are part of a Memorandum of Understanding between the District and UTLA that provides certain autonomies over budget, governance, curriculum, and assessment, and the school calendar to meet their specific students’ needs; and
 
Whereas, The structure which supports authentic engagement and shared decision making at a community school is the Local School Leadership Council (LSLC); now, therefore be it

Brief Description:
description
(California Department of Education’s Transitional Kindergarten Qualification Requirements) Recommends recognizing as Transitional Kindergarten compliant any multiple subject credentialed teacher who previously served as a teacher of record in a classroom with preschool-age children for at least one good year or who successfully completes the District’s Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program. These would serve as two District recognized pathways to meet the additional state Transitional Kindergarten qualification requirements. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Recognize multiple subject credentialed teachers who have previously served as teachers of record in a Transitional Kindergarten (TK), School Readiness Language Development Program (SRLDP), pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten, Expanded Transitional Kindergarten, Universal Transitional Kindergarten (UTK), or preschool classroom for at least one academic year, prior to August 1, 2025, as meeting the new California Department of Education’s Transitional Kindergarten teaching requirements expected of all TK teachers by August 2025.
 
Acknowledge the District’s Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program as a pathway to meet the TK requirements expected of all TK teachers by August 2025, including previous cohort participants who successfully completed the program and all future cohort completers.
 
The proposal is pursuant to the California Education Code (EC) Section 48000(g)(4), <https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=48000.&lawCode=EDC> which allows for a local education agency like the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to:
 
“Determine and document that a teacher employed by the local educational agency has professional experience in a classroom setting with preschool-age children meeting the criteria established by the governing board or body of the local educational agency that is comparable to 24 units in early childhood education, child development, or both”.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Education Code section 48000(g), under the purview of the California Department of Education (CDE), requires credentialed teachers who are first assigned to a TK classroom after July 1, 2015, to have one of the following by August 1, 2025: 
●                     At least 24 units in early childhood education, or childhood development, or both
●                     Professional experience in a classroom setting with preschool-age children comparable to the 24 units of education described in bullet 1 (comparability determined by the local employing agency)
●                     Child Development Teacher Permit, or an early childhood education specialist credential, issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing
 
To support teachers in meeting the State’s new TK teaching requirements, the Division of Human Resources (HR) and the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) recommend the Board of Education recognize teachers’ one year minimum of previous teaching experience with preschool-age children to be comparable to the required 24 units of early childhood education and authorize HR to grant the 24-unit comparability to teachers who complete the District’s Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program.
 
The Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program was developed in 2021 in partnership between HR and ECED. The program is currently supporting its third cohort of educators with 105 hours of professional learning in hybrid and real-time, which includes 30 hours of face-to-face instructor-led training, 45 hours of self-paced online training, and 30 hours of independent work spent creating five competency-based artifacts that require candidates to demonstrate the application of their learning in a TK setting. The program equips participants with specialized, research-based skills tailored to meet the unique challenges of early education.
 
Expected Outcomes:
That the Board of Education approve previous professional work experience or completion of the Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program as pathways to meeting the State’s updated requirements for teaching Transitional Kindergarten. Approval of both pathways ensures the District has sufficient qualified early education staff to fill current and future TK assignments, which will be critical for meeting the District’s goal of expanding Universal Preschool and TK programs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve previous professional work experience or completion of the Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program as pathways to meeting the State’s new requirements for teaching TK, may result in a shortage of District teachers meeting TK qualifications by the August 2025 deadline, thus putting the District out of compliance with California Department of Education’s mandate. 
 
Failure to approve the recommended comparability pathways requires teachers to identify alternative methods to acquire the requisite qualifications, such as enrolling in local programs and paying for the additional coursework. Teachers may opt out of teaching TK classes to avoid the new requirements and potential associated costs. 
 
As of Fall 2024-2025, approximately 1,100 teachers were identified as carrying a general education TK roster, with 61% of these teachers meeting the updated CDE TK requirements.  As TK programs continue to expand, the District’s need for TK compliant teachers will continue to grow.
 
The CDE will assess an audit penalty for each TK teacher that does not meet the credentialing requirements in the 2026 fiscal year. The estimated penalty is currently $246,000 per teacher that is out of compliance with the credentialing requirement, although this amount is subject to change.
 
Policy Implications: 
Education Code section 48000(g) requires credentialed teachers who are first assigned to a Transitional Kindergarten classroom after July 1, 2015, to have one of the following by August 1, 2025: 
●                     At least 24 units in early childhood education, or childhood development, or both
●                     Professional experience in a classroom setting with preschool-age children comparable to the 24 units of education (comparability determined by the local employing agency)
●                     Child Development Teacher Permit issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing
 
Recognizing professional work experience or completion of the Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program as pathways for meeting the new TK teaching requirements ensures the District is in compliance with California Department of Education’s early education teaching criteria. In addition, supporting teachers in meeting State early education requirements is critical to meeting LAUSD’s goal of expanding high-quality Universal Preschool and TK offerings for all children.
 
Moreover, approving the District’s Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program as a pathway for current and future teachers to satisfy the TK teaching requirements and/or to expand their knowledge of TK instruction, aligns with LAUSD’s Strategic Plan priority of investing in staff with competency-based, rigorous, and relevant professional learning opportunities.
 
Budget Impact: 
The District’s Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program is jointly supported and funded through ECED and HR. Program expenses include training resources, materials, and staff time. Continued funding will be necessary to maintain program quality if the District’s expansion of TK and preschool programs increases the demand for highly qualified early childhood staff, thus increasing Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing enrollment.
 
Student Impact:
Providing TK students with access to experienced teachers, with first hand knowledge of preschool-age learning pedagogy, and/or to teachers who have completed a high-quality micro-credential program in early childhood education will offer a unique blend of expertise and fresh, innovative perspectives to our TK student population. Experienced teachers bring a wealth of knowledge and understanding of child development, classroom management, and proven instructional strategies, fostering a stable and nurturing learning environment.  Teachers without this prior teaching experience, will have access to specialized preparation through the micro-credentialing program, which incorporates the latest research-based practices, innovative approaches in early childhood education, and coaching and feedback from experts in the field of TK instruction. This dynamic teaching force will provide a balanced, robust early learning foundation that will support the cognitive, social, and emotional growth of TK students throughout the District, in preparation for future academic success.

Issues and Analysis: 
The work experience and Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program compliance pathways effectively addresses key District challenges, including potential TK staff shortages and non-compliance of State mandates by validating the experience of the teachers who have served in preschool-age classrooms. The Early Childhood Micro-Credentialing Program builds the capacity of existing staff; supports employee retention by providing structured, meaningful growth opportunities leading to increased job satisfaction; and the Program ensures LAUSD remains compliant with California Department of Educations’ mandates, policies and quality benchmarks by adjusting program curriculum to incorporate new State learning foundations.

Since the 2021-22 school year, LAUSD has leveraged ELO-P grant funds to expand after-school and summer learning programs for TK/K-6th grade and secondary students upon meeting minimum state requirements pursuant to EC section 8482 et seq.
 
As mandated by the California Department of Education (CDE) under EC section 8482.3(g)(1), Local Education Agencies (LEAs) must develop, review, and update ELO-P plans every three years or sooner if substantive changes occur. The District’s initial plan was reviewed and approved by the Los Angeles Board of Education in May of 2022. To maintain compliance with CDE requirements and provide the Los Angeles Board of Education with an updated plan reflecting program enhancements, the 2024-25 Expanded Learning Opportunities Program Plan is submitted for Board approval. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the ELO-P plan will enhance student access to high-quality, equitable expanded learning programs across LAUSD. The revised plan prioritizes:
 
•                     Expansion of Before & After-School Programs - Increased availability of grant and non-grant funded programs to ensure greater student participation.
•                     Intersession Enrichment - Beyond the Bell and the Division of Instruction will collaborate to deliver intersession programs, including Winter and Spring Academies, Summer School, and targeted enrichment programs.
•                     Professional Development - Robust training for district and agency staff to enhance safety, student engagement, and social-emotional learning environments.
 

•                     Enrichment Programming - Offering hands-on, student-centered activities, including:
o                     Art and Music learning experiences
o                     STEAM learning experiences
o                     Internships and career exploration opportunities
o                     Dual language and multilingual enrichment programs
o                     Academic skill-building initiatives
o                     Field trips designed to foster real-world learning
 
•                     Social-Emotional Wellness - Partnership with Student Mental Health & Wellness to integrate Psychiatric Social Workers during expanded learning hours.
 
•                     Extended School Year - Supporting special education students by providing engaging, skill-maintenance programs for students with Individualized Education Programs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote would ensure that LAUSD can continue leveraging ELO-P funds to provide high-quality, accessible expanded learning programs for students.
 
A “NO” vote would jeopardize funding, limiting the district’s ability to provide vital after-school, summer, and enrichment opportunities.
 
Policy Implications: 
This does not change District Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
Local Education Agencies have until June 30, 2025, to spend 2023-24 allocated funds, and until June 30, 2026, for 2024-25 allocations. Funds must be used exclusively for ELO-P-related activities deemed necessary and reasonable.
 
Student Impact:
The ELO-P plan is equity-driven, ensuring historically underserved students gain increased access to enrichment, academic support, and social-emotional resources. Pre- and post-program assessments will be conducted to measure student academic progress, social development, and overall engagement.

Score Rationale



Recognition

     3

The GSPP grant directly addresses historical inequities in access to Career Technical Education (CTE by prioritizing equitable opportunities for all students, particularly those with exceptional needs. This commitment aligns with the California Department of Education’s (CDE) emphasis on equity and is a key factor in CTE program evaluation.



Resource Prioritization

     3

To ensure equitable access to high-quality CTE, this GSPP grant prioritizes resources based on student need. LAUSD targets schools and CTE pathways that have historically received less funding from other sources (e.g., Perkins, Strong Workforce Program, CTEIG). These funds support targeted professional development by building educator capacity to address achievement gaps and effectively serve special populations. By equipping CTE pathways with comprehensive support services and integrated work-based learning experiences, we aim to provide all students the resources they need to succeed in college and careers.



Result

     3

CTE classes and pathways empower students to explore diverse career options and develop in-demand, career-ready skills that lead to living-wage employment, particularly crucial in communities facing opportunity and achievement gaps.

Brief Description:
description
(We Can Work Contract with the California Department of Rehabilitation) Recommends approval to continue the We Can Work contract between LAUSD and the California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) to provide work experience for over 200 adult transition (Career and Transition Center) students a year.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the continuation of the We Can Work program contract to continue for the next three fiscal years from July 2025 through June 2028. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
We Can Work is a California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) program that provides DOR Student Services to students in school districts throughout California. Since 2017, the We Can Work program in LAUSD has provided over 200 students a year with paid Work-based Learning Experiences to prepare them for competitive integrated employment. Work experience is one of the DOR Student Services that students with disabilities are eligible to receive when they apply for supports through the agency. By entering into a contract with LAUSD, the DOR expands their ability to reach students and improve employment outcomes for Californians. 
 
The DOR is a state-wide agency with four districts that serve the LAUSD community - Van Nuys Foothill District, Greater Los Angeles District, Los Angeles South Bay District, and Blind Field Services. Collaboration among DOR districts and LAUSD is the cornerstone of this contract with each student assigned a DOR counselor and an LAUSD district staff member to monitor progress toward student employment goals. 
 
DOR Student Services Work-based Learning Experience consists of short-term placements either on or off campus and monitoring of the program participant’s performance in the work environment. Work experience may include paid/unpaid internships, paid/unpaid placement, summer work experience, work exploration and job shadowing. The DOR applicant and/or recipient of DOR services may participate in more than one work experience situation. Work experiences are intended to be temporary placements to gain experience in the workplace. They may also result in the development of any of the following: vocational direction, appropriate work attitudes, ethics, interpersonal skills, speed, and accuracy, foundational employment skills. Work experiences will be individualized and can vary in duration as well as type of placement. Work experience hours are expected to average up to 300 hours per participant per year depending on individual need and interest.
 
This We Can Work case service contract will provide services for eligible participants with disabilities attending a Career and Transition Center (CTC), Center for Advanced Transition Skills (CATS), senior high school, learning center, or complex within the Los Angeles Unified School District, and their supporting schools. The following is a partial list of the schools participating in this program and is subject to change based upon the opening and closing of school sites: 
•                     Banneker Career and Transition Center 
•                     Career and Transition Center West 
•                     Leichman Career Preparatory and Transition Center 
•                     Lowman Career and Transition Center 
•                     Miller Career and Transition Center 
•                     Perez Special Education Center 
•                     Widney Career Preparatory and Transition Center 
•                     Willenberg Career and Transition Center 
 
During the current contract term (July 2022-June 2025), LAUSD has met and/or exceeded the goal of serving 206 students each year and continues to meet all other contract expectations. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
The We Can Work Contract includes the following goals: 
 
•                     For fiscal year 2025-2026, a total of 206 unduplicated participants DOR services will receive services through this contract. 
•                     For fiscal year 2026-2027, a total of 206 unduplicated participants DOR services will receive services through this contract. 
•                     For fiscal year 2027-2028, a total of 206 unduplicated participants DOR services will receive services through this contract.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote will authorize LAUSD to continue to offer 206 students a paid work experience each year and will fund the coordination of this work through 1 FTE. 
 
A “NO” vote will result in LAUSD not being able to offer students in adult transition/Career and Transition Center programs an opportunity for work experience that also familiarizes them with an agency that will continue to support employment as adults. Teacher Coordinator positions will not be funded without approval. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The We Can Work contract covers the costs of the program and does not impact the budget otherwise. The annual funding of $584,950 covers staff and student work experience costs. 
 
Student Impact:
Across all age groups, persons with disabilities are much less likely to be employed than those with no disabilities (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, February 2024). The National Technical Assistance Center on Transition indicates that paid employment/work experience is a research-based practices correlated with future student employment success. This ongoing partnership between Los Angeles Unified School District and the Department of Rehabilitation provides services and paid work-based learning experiences for students with disabilities to prepare them for future employment.

Brief Description:
description
(Official LAUSD Land Acknowledgement) Recommends adoption of the proposed Land Acknowledgement developed in consultation with local tribes.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt a Los Angeles Unified School District spoken and written land acknowledgment statement (Attachment A).
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified, LAUSD, or District) is committed to honoring the cultures, histories, and perspectives of local tribes and fostering an inclusive environment that recognizes and celebrates the contributions and experiences of Indigenous peoples in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. 
 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) occupies land originally inhabited and still cared for by the Gabrieleño and Fernandeño Tataviam tribes. The region of Tovangar, now known as the Greater Los Angeles Basin, is the distinct homeland of the present-day Gabrieleño/Tongva, whose origins trace back to the cultures preceding the establishment of the San Gabriel Mission, from which the name ""Gabrieleño"" was derived. The Fernandeño Tataviam People inhabited the northern region of Los Angeles County and eastern Ventura County, including areas such as San Fernando, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, and Antelope Valleys, and their culture predates the establishment of Mission San Fernando, from which the name ""Fernandeño"" originated. The District has a large American Indian/Alaska Native and Indigenous student population, and continues efforts to support families with the self-identification process. 
 
On November 19, 2024, the Board of Education (Board) adopted the Reckoning with Our Past, Honoring our Present: Developing a Los Angeles Unified Land Acknowledgement Resolution (Res-017-24/25), which called for the District to collaborate with local recognized tribes to develop a public land acknowledgement statement, among other things.  The proposed land acknowledgment statement (Attachment A) was developed in consultation with representatives from the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians and the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians. Tribal consultations, held on February 13 and 26, 2025, fostered open dialogue, and the collaboration enabled the development of a respectful and authentic land acknowledgment statement.  Tribal leaders from the following tribes were also invited to participate and provide consultation:  
 
•                     Gabrieleno/Tongva San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians 
•                     Gabrielino/Tongva Nation of the Greater Los Angeles Basin 
•                     Gabrielino Tongva Indians of California Tribal Council 
•                     Gabrielino-Tongva Tribe 
•                     Gabrieleno Kizh Nation 
 
To support educators, the Multilingual and Multicultural Education Department (MMED) compiled educational resources to raise awareness about the history of the land and its Indigenous peoples (Attachment B). Through these and other efforts, LAUSD aims to integrate Native and Indigenous perspectives into its educational framework. The commitment includes developing resources for Ethnic Studies and ensuring the curriculum reflects Indigenous histories and cultures. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
The Board will adopt the proposed spoken and written land acknowledgment statement (Attachment A), which staff will subsequently post on the District website with the referenced educational resources (Attachment B).  The statement will serve as both recognition and an educational tool, integrating Indigenous perspectives into curricula and promoting inclusivity for Native students and families. 
 
Beyond symbolism, the acknowledgment affirms LAUSD’s commitment to equity and social justice, strengthening relationships with Indigenous communities and encouraging ongoing dialogue about reconciliation. By implementing a land acknowledgment, LAUSD takes a meaningful step toward fostering respect, inclusion, and accountability while creating a more informed and equitable school community.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote will authorize the adoption of the land acknowledgment statement, which will be  published on the District’s website with accompanying educational resources and tools for students and school communities to utilize.  
 
If the Board votes “NO”,  a formal land acknowledgment statement will not be adopted.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable.
 
Budget Impact: 
The land acknowledgement statement will be posted on various District webpages and does not impact the budget otherwise.
 
Student Impact:
A land acknowledgment statement can have a profound impact on students by fostering cultural awareness and education. It provides an opportunity for students to learn about the history, culture, and contributions of Indigenous communities, encouraging a deeper understanding and respect for the original inhabitants of the land. This kind of recognition not only raises awareness but also helps create a more inclusive environment by affirming the cultural heritage of Indigenous students, promoting a sense of belonging and respect for all cultures within the school community. 
 
In addition, it encourages critical thinking by prompting students to reflect on history, colonization, and the ongoing challenges faced by Native American and Indigenous communities. Such discussions can open the door to important conversations about social justice, equity, and reconciliation. For Native American and Indigenous students, seeing their heritage acknowledged can be empowering, offering a sense of validation and connection within the school environment. 
 
 
 
A land acknowledgment statement also fosters a connection to the land itself, encouraging students to recognize the importance of environmental stewardship and their place in the broader community. In this way, a land acknowledgment statement not only educates but also nurtures empathy, respect, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.

Resolution of Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators

Brief Description:
description
(Resolution of Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators) Recommends authorizing the use of emergency permits as add on authorizations for credentialed teachers in order to increase instructional options for students, minimize misassignments, and increase the subject areas in which our certificated staff is legally authorized to provide instruction. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Declare the potential number, type, and subject of emergency permits that may be needed for the ensuing school year and to specify the target languages for emergency bilingual authorizations needed to serve the dual language programs in the District (Attachment B).  Below is a list of the estimated number of permits being requested under this Declaration of Need: 
 



Document Type 

Number Requested 



Emergency CLAD Permit 

       400 



Emergency Bilingual Authorization Permit 

         60 



Emergency Resource Permit 

           5 



Emergency Teacher Librarian Services Permit 

         40 



Emergency Transitional Kindergarten Permit 

         10 



Multiple Subject Limited Assignment Permit 

         15 



Single Subject Limited Assignment Permit 

       190 



Special Education Limited Assignment Permit 

       160 


 
It is requested that the Declaration of Need be approved at the April 8, 2025, meeting of the Board of Education declaring a need for fully qualified teachers and the continued use of emergency permits in the situations described herein.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Senate Bill 435 (Watson), enacted in January 1988 requires school districts that utilize emergency permits to seek the approval of the governing board annually at a public meeting.  In November 1993, Senate Bill 148 (Bergeson) and the resulting Title 5 regulations established an additional requirement to this process.  School districts are required to annually submit to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators that has been adopted by the local Board of Education.  It is important to note that the emergency permits covered by this Declaration of Need are requested as add on authorizations for fully credentialed teachers.  The only exception to this is the Emergency Transitional Kindergarten Permit, which would only be used if there is no available teacher in the District to cover a TK assignment at a particular site.  This Declaration does not support the hiring of non-credentialed teachers. 
 
For approximately the past 19 years, a major emphasis has been placed on ensuring that all teachers are appropriately certified to teach English learners (ELs).  The progress of this endeavor is exemplified by the drastic reduction in teachers with no EL authorization from over 7,000 in 2005 to approximately 26 K-12 teachers as of March 2025. There are currently 437 teachers with emergency Cross-cultural, Language and Academic Development (CLAD) certificates or emergency Bilingual Cross-cultural, Language and Academic Development (BCLAD) certificates.  These teachers are enrolled in classes or taking the appropriate examinations to earn the full EL authorization.  The District continues to dismiss teachers who do not take the necessary steps to obtain the EL authorization.  Meanwhile, the District continues to support teachers who are in the process of completing coursework or preparing for the exam.  The Emergency CLAD and BCLAD permits are the means provided to temporarily certify teachers who are progressing toward full certification.   
 
Additionally, a limited number of emergency permits are used to certify credentialed special education teachers as resource specialists, and credentialed general education teachers as teacher librarians, while they complete the necessary coursework toward additional certification. To date, we have 3 resource specialist permit and 46 teacher librarian emergency permits issued by LAUSD. The Emergency Transitional Kindergarten (ETK) permit is a new permit that the District will be utilizing in emergency situations when a school site is unable to secure an elementary authorized candidate (provisional, intern, or credentialed) to cover their ETK class. 
 
Limited Assignment Permits are requested by school site administrators to authorize credentialed teachers to teach subjects outside of their certification area. Examples of such practice can occur at schools where teachers with practical experience and expertise often teach electives that are related to the school’s theme or in elementary and secondary dual language programs.  In addition, these permits are also utilized to assist in meeting our special education teacher need.  A teacher who is currently credentialed to teach students with Mild/Moderate eligibilities can, through the use of such a permit, earn a legally authorizing document to also serve students with Moderate/Severe (Extensive Support) eligibilities.  The teacher shortage in high need general education academic areas has also resulted in the need to utilize these permits, as credentialed teachers pursue coursework or passage of exams to add subject areas to their existing credential(s).  Such permits are closely monitored and are only issued at the request of the school principal and with the consent of the teacher.  To date, 250 Limited Assignment Permits have been issued. The Limited Assignment Permit requires that the teacher pursue coursework or pass exams in the subject area of the permit in order to qualify for a renewal.  The end result is that the teacher will pass the needed coursework and/or exams to add the authorization to their credential.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Certificated staff serving under one of the legal authorizations referenced in this Declaration of Need will be provided with guidance on how to earn the full authorization so that it can be added to their credential document.  This will result in a stronger teaching force and a richer instructional program for our students.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Education Code 44300(a)(3) sets forth the requirements for the Declaration of Need and requires the annual justification to be made in the form of a motion adopted by the governing board of the district at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing board.  The motion may not be part of the consent agenda and shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting. 
 
If the Declaration of Need is not approved, we will not be able to legally authorize teachers in the various areas referenced. This will potentially result in increased misassignments and less instructional options for our students.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of the Human Resources Division is to ensure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  The Declaration of Needs affords the District the ability to legally authorize certificated staff in additional subject areas while they pass the coursework and/or exams necessary to add additional authorizations to their credential.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Four Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of four projects essential for replacing and upgrading critical systems and components of school buildings, as detailed in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a combined budget of $25,320,917.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve four projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed projects is $25,320,917.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes a project to replace arcades and paving at Hillcrest Elementary School, a project to replace gym bleachers at Hollywood High School, a project to provide a new accessible play structure and greening improvements at Halldale Elementary School, and a project to upgrade the synthetic track, scoreboard, and tennis courts at Nathaniel Narbonne High School.
 
The project at Halldale Elementary School was awarded a grant from the Community Project Funding (CPF) program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Under the CPF program, Members of Congress select specific projects in their communities for funding which is approved as part of the annual appropriations process. Representative Nanette Barragán, an alumna of Halldale Elementary School representing California’s 44th Congressional District, designated CPF funding in the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill for the new accessible play structure and greening improvements project. This CPF grant is a cost-reimbursement award which requires initial funding to be provided and then allows documented costs to be fully reimbursed up to the project budget of $2,500,000.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve four projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the four proposed projects is $25,320,917 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. Staff anticipates reimbursement of up to $2,500,000 in CPF grant funds for the proposed project at Halldale Elementary School.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 3,800 current and future students attending these four schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

(Define and Approve the Lemay Street Early Education Center Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a project to provide an outdoor classroom and campus upgrades at Lemay Street Early Education Center (BD 3 Region N), and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a budget of $8,544,763.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the Lemay Street Early Education Center (BD 3 Region N) Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The budget for the proposed project is $8,544,763.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Project will create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classroom may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging
•                     Building materials
 
The proposed Project will provide an outdoor classroom by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. Campus upgrades include new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, roofing, irrigation system, exterior painting of the Children’s Center Building, necessary upgrades to the fire alarm system and utilities, and interim facilities to support school programs during construction. Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility upgrades include accessible path of travel, parking area, doors and signage, and a children’s restroom. The scope of work also includes any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state, and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2028.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project to improve student health, safety, and educational quality. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Project. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, access to nature-based green space will remain limited, and early education facilities needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the Project is $8,544,763 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
The Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the Project.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning, as well as address early education facilities needs that are necessary to improve student health, safety, and educational quality to benefit approximately 115 students at Lemay Street Early Education Center (Board District 3, Region North).
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor spaces will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
 
Equity Impact:
The proposed Project was identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with the Region and school site administrator. The site was selected based upon the center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Project’s proposal in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Project’s scope will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Project’s scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

(Approve an Amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Redefine the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project) Recommends approval of an amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to redefine the Bell High School (BD5, Region East) Classroom Replacement Project with a revised budget of $197,435,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve an amendment to the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to redefine the Bell High School (BD5, Region East) Classroom Replacement Project as described in Exhibit A. The budget for the redefined project is $197,435,000, an increase of $73,450,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the redefined project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Staff initially considered proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings. However, in an effort to maximize efficiencies and expedite the HVAC replacement, Staff recommends that the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project be redefined to include the replacement and upgrade of the existing HVAC systems. Coordinating and performing the proposed replacement and upgrade of the HVAC system in the Main Building, Locker & Shower Building, and Sanitary Buildings concurrently with the planned work of the Classroom Replacement project will streamline design and construction efforts and eliminate any potential duplicative work that may occur with two separate projects and general contractors.
 
The proposed redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project includes the following added scope:
 
•                     Replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, exhaust fans, and miscellaneous ductwork at the Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields.
 
•                     Installation of a new Energy Management System (EMS) for all permanent and relocatable buildings that will remain after completion of this project.
 
•                     Installation and removal of interim facilities including approximately 30 classrooms, 2 administrative spaces, and 2 restrooms necessary to support school programs during construction.
 
•                     Construction of new tennis courts and a new softball field as well as restoration of parking and landscaping where interim facilities and existing relocatable buildings are to be removed.
 
The prior scope approved in the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project included the removal of 10 existing relocatable buildings and 3 permanent buildings assuming that a standalone HVAC project would remove an additional 5 existing relocatable buildings and 1 permanent building. The redefined project includes the removal of all 15 existing relocatable buildings and 4 permanent buildings.  The prior definition also included some interim facilities; however, this has been expanded in the redefined project to expedite the replacement of classrooms and HVAC together. The complete scope, budget, and schedule for the redefined project is provided in Exhibit A.
 
Staff anticipates that construction activities will begin in the 3rd quarter of 2027. The activities for site/utilities/interim facilities may begin in advance of this work in an earlier phase. Construction is anticipated to be completed by the 4th quarter of 2031.
 
Bell High School is located in Region East and Board District 5 (Karla Griego).
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included herein as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified School District’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to redefine the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the design and construction of the redefined project.
 
The new facilities, once completed, will provide facilities that support education programs and student achievement. The redefined project will also decrease demand for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds for environmental reviews and clearances, design, procurement, construction, and other activities necessary to implement the redefined project.
 
If the proposal is not approved, the project will not be redefined, and the school will not benefit from the additional critical replacements and associated campus upgrades being proposed.
 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. The proposal is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in the District's local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by replacing existing relocatable buildings with new permanent buildings and providing critical replacements and upgrades.
 
Budget Impact: 
The redefinition of the Bell High School Classroom Replacement Project increases the project budget by $73,450,000, which results in an updated project budget of $197,435,000.  This budget reflects current information known, and assumptions about the project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the project.
 
The redefined project, including the new HVAC scope, is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.  This action will require the transfer of $73,450,000 from the SUP category of need for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components to the SUP category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.
 
Student Impact:
The redefined Bell High School Classroom Replacement project, once completed, will help ensure approximately 2,100 students attending this school are provided with safe, welcoming, and state-of-the-art learning environments that support student-centered and engaged learning.  The redefined project will also ensure the students attending Bell High School are provided with updated facilities that are well-ventilated with efficient heating and air conditioning systems that support learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Bell High School was prioritized for a classroom replacement project based on 1) the number of relocatable buildings that are not certified by the Division of the State Architect and 2) the number of students served.  The new HVAC scope was prioritized according to the critical replacement criteria of first addressing the building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The Main Building as well as the Locker & Shower and Sanitary Buildings adjacent to the playfields at Bell High School have an inefficient and unreliable HVAC system that is well beyond its useful life and needs to be replaced and upgraded with a new system. Redefining the Classroom Replacement project instead of proposing a new standalone critical replacement project to address the deteriorated HVAC system in these buildings will enable staff to better coordinate design and construction efforts, maximize budget efficiencies, and minimize impacts on the learning environment.

Body
Background: 
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) adopted an update to the School Upgrade Program (SUP) to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework. The updated SUP framework and the Measure RR Implementation Plan help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals. 
 
Pursuant to the Board Resolution, Modernization, Upgrade and Development of High School Athletic Facilities, adopted on June 22, 2021, funding has been prioritized within the SUP to modernize, upgrade, or develop new high school athletic facilities within each Board District.  Projects to upgrade high school athletic facilities within each Board District fall under the SUP category of need for School Upgrades and Reconfigurations to Support Wellness, Health, Athletics, Learning, and Efficiency.  Funds are allocated for each Board District based on each Board District’s proportionate share of high school enrollment and number of sports teams.  Proposed Project is identified by Board offices in consultation with stakeholders and developed by Facilities staff.
 
The Project includes, but is not limited to:
•                     The design and construction of a new baseball field scoreboard with connection to existing electrical panel.
 
 
•                     Requirements from the Division of the State Architect (DSA), California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), or other improvements to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations.
 
Construction is anticipated to begin in Q4-2025 and be completed in Q2-2026.  The proposed Project will support the school’s physical education and athletic programs and allow the school to practice for and/or host athletic events which contribute to student athletic achievement, school pride, and a positive school culture.
 
The proposed Project is in Board District 6 (Kelly Gonez) and Region North.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve the proposed Project and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project and expenditure of Bond Program funds.
 
The proposed Project, once completed, will support physical education programs, student athletic achievement, and athletic programs.  The proposed Project will also decrease demand for repair and maintenance, alleviate the burden on custodial staff, and benefit the local economy by creating tax revenue and new jobs.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Project in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. 
 
If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and the school will continue to operate without a new baseball scoreboard.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy. The proposal supports the implementation of the Modernization, Upgrade and Development of High School Athletic Facilities Board Resolution.  The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading athletic facilities at school.
 
Budget Impact: 
The proposed Project budget is $556,683 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency, and more specifically from the amount allocated for upgrades to athletic facilities in Board District 6.
 
The Project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions.  The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed Project, once completed, will provide a new baseball scoreboard that supports physical education programs, student athletic achievement, and athletic programs to benefit approximately 1,200 students.  The new baseball scoreboard will also allow the school to practice for and/or host games and other school community events, which builds school pride and enhances opportunities to create a positive school culture.
 
Equity Impact:
Funds are allocated for the Board District based on a proportionate share of high school enrollment and number of sports teams.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Staff will implement all opportunities to minimize construction impacts on school operations and existing athletic programs. As necessary, the temporary use of local parks, neighboring school athletic facilities, and other opportunities will be utilized to reduce impacts to the existing athletic programs at each school. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 22 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends the definition and approval of 22 Board District Priority and Region Priority projects, as detailed in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein, for a combined budget of $1,590,818.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 22 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $1,590,818.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on March 27, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the school and its students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 22 proposed projects is $1,590,818. Sixteen projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Six projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 11,900 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Brief Description:
description
(Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Filing of Applications for State Allocation Board-Administered Programs and Acknowledging Requirement to Submit Five-Year School Facilities Master Plan) Recommends adoption of a resolution to authorize Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or District) to file applications for State Allocation Board-administered programs and acknowledges, as a condition of participation in the School Facility Program, the requirement to submit a five-year school facilities master plan to the California Department of General Services, Office of Public School Construction.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adoption of the attached Board of Education resolution (Exhibit A), which authorizes LAUSD personnel to file applications for State Allocation Board-administered programs and acknowledges, as a condition of participation in the School Facility Program, the requirement to submit a five-year school facilities master plan to the California Department of General Services, Office of Public School Construction.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The State Allocation Board (SAB) is responsible for determining the allocation of state resources used to fund the new construction and modernization of public-school facilities through the School Facility Program (SFP). These funding resources come from voter-approved general obligation bond funds and other designated state funds, which are allocated into various SFP programs. LAUSD has applied for grants through these programs and has been awarded approximately $5.61 billion so far, allowing the District to build new schools, modernize existing campuses, and provide learning environments that help students achieve educational goals.
 
As a result of the passage of the Kindergarten through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024 (Proposition 2), each school district that intends to participate in the SFP must submit to the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) a five-year school facilities master plan, or an updated five-year school facilities master plan, approved by the district’s governing board. The specific elements required in the master plan, and the standards for master-plan preparation, are expected to be determined by the SAB sometime during the first half of 2025. Until the master plan is completed, a district may continue to submit SFP grant applications, provided that it submits to OPSC a resolution, approved by the district’s governing board, acknowledging the master-plan requirement, and provided that the district complies with the deadlines specified in the resolution. The attached resolution will allow LAUSD to continue filing grant applications during this period.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Adoption of the attached resolution so that LAUSD may continue filing SFP grant applications until a five-year facilities master plan can be submitted to OPSC.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this resolution will allow LAUSD to continue filing SFP grant applications without interruption.
 
Disapproval of the resolution will require LAUSD to suspend all SFP grant applications until LAUSD fulfills the five-year facilities master plan requirement. Grant applications (other than Facility Hardship and Seismic Mitigation program applications) are processed and awarded in the order in which OPSC receives them. Because of the large backlog of applications, any delay in submission of the District’s applications increases the likelihood that, even with the funds recently made available under Proposition 2, funding will be exhausted by the time these applications are processed. Therefore, disapproval of this resolution could jeopardize LAUSD’s ability to receive some SFP grants.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal advances Pillar 2 (Joy and Wellness) and Pillar 4 (Operational Effectiveness) of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by facilitating the funding of school construction projects, thus providing facilities that improve students’ access to safe, healthy, and educationally effective learning environments.
 
Budget Impact: 
SFP funding of school construction projects reduces the burden on local sources of school funding.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this resolution will allow the District to continue applying for SFP grants for the construction of modern school facilities, thus improving students’ access to a safe and healthy learning environment.
 
Equity Impact:
Grants awarded through the SFP support the District’s Bond program, which is focused on improving equity between newer and older schools so that all students have an equal opportunity for success.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

Brief Description:
description
(Home-to-School Transportation Reimbursement - Transportation Services Plan) Recommends approval of the Transportation Services Plan 2025-26 as a condition to receive approximately $44.7 million reimbursement from California Department of Education.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed:
Approval of the Transportation Services Plan 2025-26 as a stipulation to receive reimbursement or apportionments from the California Department of Education (CDE) for home-to-school transportation services. Based on the formula provided, LAUSD will receive approximately $44.7 million.
 
Background:
Home-to-School (HTS) Transportation Reimbursement was implemented by Assembly Bill (AB) 181 to provide reimbursement funding for school districts and county offices of education (COEs) based on the prior year eligible transportation expenditures and prior year Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) transportation related add-on funding. As a condition of receiving the reimbursement, a plan describing the transportation services offered to students, including those in transitional kindergarten through grade 6 and students of low income be developed and adopted by the Board of Education. The plan shall be updated by April 1st of each year thereafter. In addition to describing the transportation services provided, the attached Transportation Services Plan 2025-26 addresses other requirements from the CDE.
 
Expected Outcomes:  
As the prior year’s transportation expenditure is greater than the provided transportation add-on funding from LCFF, the reimbursement shall offset a portion of the increased expenditures. The reimbursement will be apportioned in June 2025 as part of CDE’s 2024-25 Second Principal Apportionment certification.
 
Board Options and Consequences:
If the Board votes ‘NO,’ the plan is rejected, and the District shall forgo the reimbursement. 
 
If the Board votes ‘YES,’ the plan is accepted, and the District shall receive $44.7 million in home-to-school transportation reimbursement funding.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not Applicable
 
Budget Impact:
The 2024-25 HTS Reimbursement Funding is approximately $44.7 million and is based on prior year’s eligible home-to-school transportation expenditures and prior year’s LCFF HTS add-on funding.
 
Student Impact:
The reimbursement will assist the District’s Transportation Services Branch (TSB) with providing safe and efficient home-to-school transportation services for students.
 
Equity Impact:

(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 7 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 7 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit. Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new multiple subject, English, and special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as multiple subject, English, and special education where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a no vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  A no vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.

Approval of Procurement Actions

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services: District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed on Attachment “B.”
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts, Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services:  District Credit Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Goods and General Services Contract (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed on Attachment “B.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the project approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirement of the District in accordance with Board Delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result I n immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification, may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-1718), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within the Board, approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:  
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Purchase Orders; and
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:  
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; and
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable. 
 
Equity Impact:
See attached for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; award of architectural and engineering contracts; award of professional services amendment; extra services/amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approve the proposed contract listed in Attachment B including roofing and waterproofing task order contracts and geotechnical engineering services task order contracts.

Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013, Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact: 
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up-to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.
 
Attachments:
Attachment “A” - Ratification of Facilities Contracts Actions Awarded Under Delegated Authority
Attachment “B” - Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions Not Under Delegated Authority

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Strategic Plan “Joy and Wellness” pillar represents the District’s commitment to serving the whole child - supporting students’ social, emotional, and physical health and wellness so they are prepared to focus on learning, growing, and building meaningful connections at school; 
 
Whereas, The LAUSD Strategic Plan “Engagement and Collaboration” pillar commits to meaningful family engagement recognizing the importance of our families’ knowledge, traditions, and resources and the District is dedicated to strengthening these connections;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes the responsibility of all staff to protect students from abuse and neglect by becoming knowledgeable, well-trained and prepared on procedures for filing suspected child abuse reports;
 
Whereas, In 2022 82.5% of all reports to the LA County Child protection hotline were made by mandated reporters, such as educators, law enforcement, medical staff, and others required by law to report suspected abuse or neglect, and only 16% of allegations were substantiated; 
 
Whereas, In 2022, Black children made up only 7.7% of LA County’s population but accounted for 19% of Child Protection Hotline reports, disproportionality exposing Black families to Child Protective Services at nearly 2.5 times the rate of non-Black families; 
 
Whereas, In 2022 AB2805 redefined ""general neglect"" for purposes of the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA) by excluding a person's economic disadvantage and instead allows mandated reporters to offer support to families instead of reporting them;
 
Whereas, In 2023 the LA County Board of Supervisors passed the motion, “Evolving from Mandated Reporter to Mandated Supporter, shifting from “mandated reporting” to “mandating supporting” through supporting professionals in deciding whether families need Department of Children and Family Services intervention or community-based services. This includes improving decision-making tools, data analysis, expanding community services, and creating standardized training; and
 
Whereas, April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month, recognized by Congress in 1982 to raise awareness, promote support for families and advocate for prevention; now, therefore it be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) commits to a holistic vision beyond compliance towards compassion, promoting the safety of children and the support of families where there may be suspicion of neglect or abuse, aiming to keep all children safe, reduce disparities for Black children and children living in poverty, and supporting all parents and caregivers with dignity and respect;
 
Resolved further, That the Board recognizes April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month in 2025 and every year thereafter; and be it finally; 
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District will review and revise its Child Abuse policies and trainings to align to the Board, County and State’s requirements of a Mandated Supporting Protocol that is trauma-informed, equity-focused, and resource-connected.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District prepares all students to thrive in college, career and beyond with the core beliefs of equity, collaboration and excellence being applied to students, staff, and all families;
 
Whereas, The LAUSD Strategic Plan Pillar 5 Investing in Staff sets a vision to recognize, empower, and support our staff and a clear focus to recruit, develop and retain our talented and dedicated staff, along with sustaining staff wellness;
 
Whereas, The LAUSD Strategic Plan Pillar 3 Engagement and Collaboration propels us towards being a model district for authentic family engagement which begins in the earliest years setting a foundation for and honoring that the first and most important teacher for each child is their parent/caregiver;
 
Whereas, Becoming an employer of choice requires providing comprehensive and competitive compensation and support including benefits that promote the holistic wellness of our employees during all stages of their life;
 
Whereas, In 2024, Under Pressure: The U. S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on the Mental Health and Well-Being of Parents elevated the importance of parental stress, mental health and well-being, stressors unique to parenting, and the bidirectional relationship between parental mental health and child outcomes; recommending employers take action by expanding policies and programs that support the well-being of parents and caregivers in the workplace such as: offering paid parental, medical and sick leave; flexible and fair work schedules; access to child care; and implementing training for managers on work-life harmony and a family-friendly culture;  
 
Whereas, Research documents that the postpartum period is a critical time for the health, development and well-being of both the mother and baby and paid parental leave policies bolster the maternal mental and physical health, and leaves of shorter than 12 weeks are associated with higher rates of maternal depression, stress and anxiety, increased work stress and overload, and reduced understanding of infant development and bonding;
 
Whereas, Employers that have extended their paid parental leaves saw higher rates of retention, for example when Google extended its paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks, attrition dropped by 50% and when Aetna extended its maternity leave the share of women returning to work increased from 77 to 91%;
 
Whereas, Research documents that women who receive paid maternity leave are significantly more likely to return to work and employee stability is unquestionably critical for supporting academic achievement;
 
Whereas, In 2024 the Learning Policy Institute’s updated their research-based teacher turnover calculator, which estimates the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training a new teacher in large, public school districts such as Boston Public Schools and Chicago Public Schools can cost $29,650 and $29,762 respectively and that the cost of losing teachers also negatively impacts student achievement and instructional quality, resulting in greater potential costs in tutoring and professional development;
 
Whereas, After California passed its paid family leave policy, research found long-term child physical health improvements lasting through elementary school, and poverty risk among mothers of infants decreased by more than 10%, among other positive effects;
 
Whereas, California became the first state to provide paid family leave in 2004, which gives a portion of an employees’ salary to take leave to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying event because of a family member's military deployment  for those that pay into state disability, yet the majority of public employees including LAUSD employees do not have access to this benefit and they must use vacation or illness time to receive pay during their leave, receiving half-pay or no pay when earned illness depletes;
 
Whereas, Recognizing the importance of this benefit in January 2025, California increased leave payments for paid family leave to 90% of income for workers making up to $60,000 a year and 70% for workers that make more than that;
 
Whereas, AB65 (Aguiar-Currie), currently in committee, is a statewide effort supported by educators to provide 14 weeks of fully paid pregnancy leave to school employees who currently must take their earned illness, partial pay and unpaid time for pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage and recovery from such experiences;
 
Whereas, District employees whose bargaining unit has not chosen to bargain to participate in state disability, must use vacation or sick time in order to receive compensation during their Family and Medical Leave, Pregnancy Disability Leave, and when they run out of full-time pay receive half-time pay or unpaid leave;
 
Whereas, Inequitable access to paid parental leave places an inequitable burden on employees, often times resulting in employees being forced to make impossible choices to return before it is optimal for their own and their family’s wellness or face financial hardship; this burden is most heavily felt by women and employees who are single parents, who do not earn vacation, without access to child care support and those historically under-resourced;
 
Whereas, California passed SB 729, which requires large and small group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2025, to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility and fertility services;
 
Whereas, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is the leading use of Assistive Reproductive Technology (ART); the use of home births and doulas are on the rise; and none of these supports are currently covered by any health care plan offered to LAUSD employees;
 
Whereas, Research documents the critical role early learning and care programs play in the cognitive, socioemotional learning, school readiness, and health and well-being of our earliest learners and provides essential resources and supports to parents and caregivers; and as an education institution it is our responsibility to ensure our employees have equitable access to high quality, affordable early learning and care; and
 
Whereas, the Economic Policy Institute reported in February 2025 the average cost of infant-care in California is $21,945, more than twice the cost of in-state tuition for California public universities and roughly 18.4% of the median family income when the Department of Health and Human Services deems childcare “affordable” at no more than 7% of family income; 
 
Whereas, In June 2021 the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District unanimously passed “Mommy, Daddy and Me,” a student-board member authored resolution calling for a plan, informed by student-parents, that creates a more robust and comprehensive student maternity support system, and an ideal school setting for student-parents; now, therefore it be,
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District values all families and is committed to being an employer of choice as a critical component of being a premier school district, including for parent-employees and employees planning to become parents; respecting the full scope of family building and thriving, including:
 
•                     Family planning, becoming pregnant (inclusive of fertility treatment like that of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI)), adoption and fostering, physical and mental health from miscarriage and loss;
•                     Pregnancy, parental and family leave, including prenatal and postpartum care and education, adequate time and support for preparation, recovery and returning to work, access to high quality lactation spaces and necessary accommodations;
•                     Early learning and care from 0-5 years old, including seeking partnerships with family childcare and non-profit providers and cost-savings for affordable care, and placement in and strategic growth of LAUSD infant centers and Early Education Centers (EECs); and
•                     Education from preschool through college, encouraging and supporting employees to enroll their children in LA Unified Early Education Centers and UTK-12 programs, offering employees priority where possible.
 
Resolved further, That the Los Angeles Unified School District, consistent with and subject to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and privacy laws, will evaluate the following data, where available, in preparation for a written report and public presentation to the Board:
 
•                     General employee demographics for context such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, location, parental status, marital status, labor union representation, and retention;
•                     Average and range of time actually taken off by staff for all leave types related to reasons of pregnancy, family bonding, kin care for a child’s illness, prenatal care including but not limited to whether the days were paid or unpaid and by position type;
•                     Potential budgetary implications for offering paid family leave programs for at least 12 weeks, given historical data of the number of employees that take such leave in LAUSD and Los Angeles more broadly;
•                     Percentage of employee-parents with children enrolled in LAUSD EECs and UTK-12 schools; and
•                     Health care plan coverage and cost for prenatal, postnatal and family planning including but not limited to assisted reproductive technology, delivery, doula, home birth, midwife support, and lactation support.
 
Resolved further, That the District, consistent with and subject to EEO and privacy laws, will conduct or procure a study on the needs, concerns, and experiences for LA Unified employees and/or employees in Los Angeles related to reproductive health and parenting support in preparation for a written report and public presentation to the Board of information, as it relates to improving the experience of employees, such as:
 
•                     Interest in becoming a parent or caregiver;
•                     Fertility and Family Planning Needs including interest and awareness of access to ART;
•                     Impact of access or lack thereof to District-provided reproductive supports on an employee’s satisfaction, retention and ability to work;
•                     Health care benefits; Desired time and actual time taken for pre- and postpartum care and child bonding;
•                     Barriers to why individuals do not take more time for all stages of their child’s life from birth through college;
•                     Average and range of costs of child care;

Recommends approval of the 15 named and prior provisionally approved, members of the Integrated Pest Management Team.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
The Board of Education (“Board”) is asked to approve the appointment of 15 named and prior provisionally approved individuals to the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”). 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”; see Attachment A).  The Team serves to provide guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property and the environment. 
 
The District operates its pest control activities within the framework of the Policy, which itself conforms to the standards of the Healthy Schools Act (“HSA”).  Furthermore, the Policy articulates terms and guidelines by which the Team must act, and specifies how Team membership is to be constituted.
 
On June 29, 2022, an audit by the LAUSD Office of Inspector General (see Attachment B) concluded that the Integrated Pest Management program was largely compliant with the Policy and the HSA.  However, the audit identified procedural issues, notably: (1) the lack of an effective training program for stakeholders; (2) the need for a document review process to ensure HSA compliance; and (3) the need to realign Team appointments and recruitment with the Policy.
 
Since 2010, neither the Board nor any of its committees have approved Team members to serve their designated terms.  As a result, none of the currently participating individuals have been formally appointed to the Team.
 
On November 15, 2022, the Board authorized the formation of an Integrated Pest Management Ad Hoc Committee, tasked with re-constituting the Team by provisionally approving then-existing Team participants.  The Team was re-constituted with those participants as well as two additional individuals who had been initially vetted.
 
On August 27, 2024, the Integrated Pest Management Ad Hoc Committee met, approved and appointed all individuals to a provisional sixty day term, which was subsequently extended for an additional sixty days by the Board.
 
In the interim, the Board Secretariat has worked with the provisionally appointed individuals to reconfirm their commitments to serve on the Team, and collect their resumes and Certification Of Confidentiality & No Financial Interests forms.  Materials for all individuals who currently intend to proceed with full term appointments to the Team are attached hereto as Attachment C.  All remaining vacant positions will be presented for approval to the Board or one of its committees at a later date.  
 
This report incorporates by reference Board Report No. 107-22/23 (Integrated Pest Management Referral), which was adopted by the Board on November 15, 2023.  Moving forward, Team members will serve and complete their tenures in accordance with the Policy.  In the absence of the Board’s approval of future Team members, membership approval will be presented to a Board committee or the Committee of the Whole, as deemed by the Board Secretariat. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the 15 named and prior provisionally approved individuals to the Team, in alignment with the Policy.  The Team and all of its members will proceed consistent with the terms of the Policy. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges, and the Team’s membership will not be constituted in a manner consistent with the Policy. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Positive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.

Body
 
description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to being the district of choice for families; 
 
Whereas, In 2017, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) unanimously passed Res-016-17/18, “TECH App: Transforming Engagement via Communication Hubs: Creating a New LAUSD App” which directed the District to create and maintain a District-wide smartphone app so that families could easily access, navigate, and provide meaningful input regarding information that is important to them in supporting their children’s academic success;
 
Whereas, The District uses the learning management system, Schoology, where students can monitor their grades and upload their assignments in a digital environment; and where parents can access their student’s grades, Individual Education Plans, and school announcements, complete magnet applications, and access other pertinent information about their students and schools through the parent portal, a digital platform;
 
Whereas, The District has started modernizing its systems. A recent Transportation modernization request for proposal sought “equipment and services to deliver modern systems to support operations of school buses and trucks of varying sizes.” And the District’s YumYummi application now allows parents and families to view daily, weekly, and monthly school meal offerings online. Departments across the District-including schools and offices-should utilize modern systems to support their operations;
 
Whereas, While the District has begun modernizing its processes, many District systems remain outdated and duplicative, often relying on hard copies, manual data entry, and antiquated processes. For example, families complete the same emergency contact information year after year, with no option to digitally submit pre-populated information from the previous year. These systems create frustrations for busy employees, parents, and community members; 
 
Whereas, Access to efficient and transparent online systems is especially important in 2025. We live in an increasingly digital world where you can order food online and pay with a mobile application, apply for a passport, and renew a driver's license or identification card. While the District has worked towards eliminating the digital divide, families do not have the option to make credit card payments online, utilize online booking systems, or complete annual enrollment forms online;
 
Whereas, Digitizing not only has positive environmental impacts due to the limited need for paper copies, but it also frees up schedules for other essential job functions and student support;
 
Whereas, Pillar 4D of the Strategic Plan focuses on operational effectiveness and includes updating processes and policies to strengthen student enrollment and academic success;
 
Whereas, The District has yet to digitize many internal systems and processes which causes delays and leads to frustration for families, community members, and staff. These outdated systems and processes include, but are not limited to:
 
•                     School enrollment;
•                     Emergency cards;
•                     Permission forms (i.e., field trip slips);
•                     Recording excused absences;
•                     Special Education reimbursement;
•                     Early Education Center payments;
•                     Leasing and civic center permits and payment;
•                     Transportation attendance and routes;
•                     Timesheet and mileage forms;
•                     Absence for illness and non-illness, family illness, and new child leave forms;
•                     TB Compliance forms;
•                     Cumulative records;
•                     Expanded learning sign-in and out forms
 
Whereas, The recent wildfires damaged thousands of hard copy cumulative records, emergency forms, and other critical documents that weren’t yet digitized; and
 
Whereas, The time it takes to process paper copies and physical receipts has put the District at risk for being out of compliance with mandated timelines; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified District (District) shall:
 
•                     Conduct an audit review of all its current systems and processes-both internal and external-to determine which can be digitized and modernized for ease of use and provide a report on the findings to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) within 60 120 days;
•                     Continue current efforts to fully digitize school enrollment forms, field trip permission slips, special education reimbursements, and leasing and civic center permits and payments by the end of 2025;
•                     Develop a plan outlining the feasibility, considerations, cost, timeline, and requirements for digitizeing and modernizeing the remaining processes listed above-and others identified in the audit review  by District departments-and eliminateing paper applications as the primary method for submission of documents and information for anything that is not expressly required by law by December June 30, 2025. While parents and guardians shall still have an option to complete forms via hard copies, digital systems and processes shall be prioritized by leveraging a Districtwide communications campaign;
•                     Conduct stakeholder and community feedback sessions by October 2025 with parents and guardians, District staff, and vendors and partners to gather input on modernization efforts;
•                     Fully implement the plan with all systems and processes digitized before by school year 2026-27, with quarterly updates to the Board until that process is complete.",,,,,,,,

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Three Campus Reconstruction Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of three Campus Reconstruction projects, as described in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a combined budget of $604,205,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve three Campus Reconstruction Projects (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The combined budget for the proposed Projects is $604,205,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
In early January 2025, Los Angeles County experienced historic and catastrophic losses due to severe windstorms and multiple wildfires that devastated many cherished communities. For the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD, Los Angeles Unified, or the District), the Palisades Fire caused an unprecedented loss of facilities due to fire damage with significant impacts to Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School. The recommended scope, schedule, and budget for the design and reconstruction of these campuses has been developed to expedite the repopulation of the affected schools as a critical step in the recovery of the Pacific Palisades community.
 
On January 14, 2025, the Board of Education (Board) adopted a resolution declaring emergency conditions as a result of the severe windstorms and fire conditions (Emergency Conditions Resolution). This Board action also authorized the execution of emergency contracts through June 30, 2025, to address these emergency conditions and help ensure the continuation of public education, the health and safety of District students and staff, and the repair and restoration of District property. The Facilities Services Division created emergency projects in response to this resolution to begin preliminary site clearance and remediation at the three schools significantly impacted by the Palisades Fire.
 
The Campus Reconstruction Projects proposed in this action will restore and rebuild the Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School campuses. Marquez Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School includes two phases: Phase 1 provides interim facilities and site restoration to provide students with the opportunity to return to their campuses and Phase 2 provides permanent construction with new buildings and facilities for each campus, as detailed in Exhibit A. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed, as detailed in Exhibit A.  
 
The Campus Reconstruction Projects will be implemented under the School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - which was updated by Board actions in 2021 and 2024 to integrate Measures RR and US funds into categories of need that represent goals guiding project development. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School will be funded by the category of need for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses while the proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School will be funded by the category of need for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions. Projects developed under both of these categories of need are included in the Facilities SEP. Although the Projects will be funded by local bonds, external funding sources are being sought as reimbursement to the Bond Program as well as to the emergency projects; these sources could include funding from insurance proceeds, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the State of California School Facilities Program.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three proposed Projects. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to provide facilities that promote student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and the campus reconstruction efforts will not move forward.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing new facilities that are urgently needed due to the devastating Palisades Fire.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $604,205,000. The proposed Projects for Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter Elementary School, with a combined budget of $337,584,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. The proposed Project for Palisades Charter High School, with a budget of $266,621,000, will be funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
LAUSD is pursuing additional funding from numerous external sources including insurance claims, FEMA, and the State of California School Facilities Program. Staff does not yet know the amount or timing of receipt of funds from any of these potential sources, some of which may be available only as reimbursement. Depending on the timing, any external funding received for these projects would be used in lieu of, or as reimbursement to, bond funds. Even after receiving potential external funding, it is anticipated that some portion of funding from the Bond Program will be required to complete the proposed Projects. Additionally, any bond eligible costs that have been incurred on the emergency projects will be transferred to the Campus Reconstruction Projects.  
 
Each Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual Project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to provide facilities that help ensure the approximately 3,620 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact:
These Projects replace facilities at Marquez Charter Elementary School, Palisades Charter Elementary School, and Palisades Charter High School that were impacted by the Palisades Fire. Permanent facilities will be constructed to serve the student enrollment at each school prior to the Palisades Fire.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
LAUSD is committed to restoring these three school communities by providing facilities that allow for the expeditious repopulation of each campus. Initially, interim facilities will be placed to provide students with the opportunity to return to Marquez Charter Elementary School and Palisades Charter High School. Palisades Charter Elementary School will remain at its current temporary location of Brentwood Elementary Science Magnet until the Palisades Charter Elementary School campus is restored and the new buildings are constructed. Thereafter, the District will design and construct permanent replacement facilities to fully restore the operations of each school.
 
Facilities assessments, environmental remediation efforts, planning and design efforts, interim facilities procurement and installation, and other activities that were immediately necessary in response to the Palisades Fire are currently underway as part of the emergency projects created in response to the Emergency Conditions Resolution. The proposed Campus Reconstruction Projects will meet the District’s commitment to a prompt reopening of these schools.
 
It may be necessary to undertake additional feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects prior to initiating design. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If it is determined the proposed Project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the proposed Project scopes, schedules, and budgets will be revised accordingly.

Body
Background: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution, which is a resolution that authorizes the issuance of up to $1,000,000,000of GO Bonds under Measure Q, Measure RR, Measure US or any combination of the foregoing to finance projects authorized under the respective measure and the form of documents necessary to issue the GO Bonds. The General Obligation Bonds Resolution authorizes the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Deputy Controller to affect the issuance of the GO Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions. In addition, consistent with the District’s practice for prior GO Bonds, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution provides for a request to the Board of Supervisors of the County to adopt a corresponding resolution providing for the issuance of the GO Bonds pursuant to the Education Code. The GO Bonds are currently expected to be sold in Fall 2025.
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, as determined by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the General Obligation Bonds Resolution also authorizes the sale of the GO bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility provided, and the ability to include a retail order period and provide meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. Finance, in accordance with the procedures established in the Debt Management Policy, has completed the process of selecting certain members of the financing team from the respective legal counsel and municipal advisor benches. The financing team for the upcoming transaction will include Dannis Woliver Kelley as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel and Public Resources Advisory Group, as Municipal Advisor. In addition, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association will serve as Paying Agent. The Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager(s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1 and Education Code Section 15146, the Board of Education has obtained from Public Resources Advisory Group, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the General Obligation Bonds Resolution.
The GO Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law and as authorized by voters within the District pursuant to Measure Q, Measure RR, and Measure US.
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the issuance of the General Obligation Bonds will enable the District to enter the market to finance approved capital projects.
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of GO Bonds to finance approved capital projects.
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and Article 4 Section 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
Budget Impact: 
There will be no material impact on the District’s General Fund. The identified projects will be funded with bond proceeds, and debt service will be repaid by ad valorem property tax revenues, not the District’s general fund revenues.
Student Impact:
The issuance of the General Obligation Bonds will improve the District’s capital facilities and information technology resources for the benefit of the students.

Body
Background: 
This Board Report seeks Board approval of the Master Refunding Resolution, which is a master resolution for the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds in an amount not-to-exceed $5.1 billion through Fiscal Year 2025-26. The purpose of the Master Refunding Resolution is to enable the District to quickly take advantage of favorable market conditions if they arise, and to reduce tax-payers’ debt service costs through economic refundings. The District has periodically used this approach in the past to authorize its general obligation refunding bonds. The Master Refunding Resolution authorizes the Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Deputy Controller to effect the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds and carry out all necessary acts related to the transaction or transactions. 
While the District typically issues refunding bonds on a tax-exempt basis, it is possible that either tax-exempt or taxable refunding structures may generate significant savings to justify an economic refunding. As a result, the Master Refunding Resolution provides the flexibility to issue the GO Refunding Bonds on either a tax-exempt or taxable basis if circumstances arise that favor one or the other structure. The Master Refunding Resolution also authorizes the forms of documents necessary to issue the GO Refunding Bonds. 
Based on the District’s Debt Management Policy, the Master Refunding Resolution authorizes the sale of the GO Refunding Bonds through the negotiated method of sale in light of current market conditions, the District’s declining enrollment and budget uncertainty, the debt structuring flexibility, and the ability to include a retail order period and meaningful roles for underwriting firms of various sizes. If refunding opportunities arise, the Chief Financial Officer shall designate the underwriters and their roles as senior manager(s), co-senior manager(s), and co-managers, in accordance with the Debt Management Policy.  Alternatively, the Master Refunding Resolution provides flexibility to issue the GO Refunding Bonds via competitive sale if favorable market conditions arise.
In compliance with Government Code Section 5852.1, the Board of Education has obtained from KNN Public Finance, as the District’s Municipal Advisor, the required costs of issuance estimates, and such estimates are disclosed in Exhibit A of the Master Refunding Resolution. 
The GO Refunding Bonds are general obligation bonds of the District secured by and payable from ad valorem property taxes to be levied within the jurisdiction of the District pursuant to the California Constitution and State law. 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the Master Refunding Resolution will enable the District to enter the market in an expedited manner to reduce the debt service costs on a portion of the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds should market conditions support one or more refundings.
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not be authorized to proceed with the issuance of the GO Refunding Bonds which, subject to favorable market conditions, may generate taxpayer savings through a refunding. 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article 1, Article 3 Section 3.02, and Article 4 Sections 4.08 and 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy. 
Budget Impact: 
The proceeds of the GO Refunding Bonds will be placed into an escrow account and used to defease and call (prepay) the refunded bonds. Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. There will be no impact on the District’s General Fund.
 
Student Impact:
The issuance of GO Refunding Bonds will reduce the taxes needed to repay the debt service on the District’s outstanding general obligation bonds and create more capacity to issue general obligation bonds in the future for new projects.
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

     3

Debt service savings from the GO Refunding Bonds will benefit the District’s taxpayers through reduced ad valorem property tax levies. Communities that have experienced historical inequities should benefit from reduced property taxes.



Resource Prioritization

     4

Savings achieved through the refunding of outstanding bonds benefit the District and its taxpayers through reduced debt service and property tax levies, respectively. This relief allows resources that would otherwise be used to service debt and property taxes, to be used for student needs.  



Results

     2

The refunding of bonds is done to achieve debt service savings and reduce ad valorem property taxes. It may result in closing achievement gaps by increasing disposable income in households located within communities that have experienced historical inequities, giving them the ability to allocate resources towards the education of their children (students).

Annually, the Local Plan’s Section D: Annual Budget Plan and Section E: Annual Service Plan must be completed, reviewed, and approved by the Local Education Agency (LEA) and submitted to the California Department of Education (CDE). Every three years, all sections (A-E) of the SELPA Local Plan must be revised. The last Board adoption of the annual SELPA Local Plan occurred in June 2024. 
 
Section A of the Local Plan “Contacts and Certifications” provides a description of the local planning process and governance structure used to ensure that special education services are delivered in compliance with state and federal laws. special education services.  
 
Section B of the SELPA focuses on governance and administration. It outlines the organizational structure, responsibilities, and procedures for governing the SELPA and implementing special education services within the region. This section may include details about the SELPA's governing board, advisory committees, decision-making processes, budget allocations, and administrative procedures for managing programs and resources. It serves as a blueprint for how the SELPA operates and ensures accountability and transparency in its administration of special education services. 
 
The Annual Budget Plan Section D projects special education revenues and expenditures. State (AB602) and Federal IDEA revenue projections are based on funding formulas that rely on student counts. The projected expenditure distribution is based on a districtwide analysis of all required Individualized Education Program (IEP) services, including low incidence and mental health services. 
 
The Annual Services Plan Section E describes the services to be provided by the Local Education Agency (LEA). 
 
The Community Advisory Committee (CAC) advised the policy and administrative agency during the development of the Local Plan, in accordance with California Education Code (EC) Section 56194. The Division of Special Education developed a Google Form to collect input from CAC members during the 30-day public review period, pursuant to California Education Code Sections 56194 (a) and (b); and 56205(a)(12)(E) and (b)(7).

end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility within eight years through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
Under the Transition Plan, each school is assigned to one of three levels of accessibility (Category One, Two, or Three) based on assessments of more than two dozen criteria including school programs, matriculation options, feeder pattern, geographic location, known (or anticipated/matriculating) population of students with disabilities or parents/guardians with disabilities, type of instructional model, and public input. The assigned category reflects the level of accessibility the site needs to meet. Schools that do not yet meet the criteria for their assigned category will undergo accessibility improvements and are prioritized for project development based on the criteria mentioned above. The three categories of accessibility are as follows: 
 
 
₋                     Category One: These are “key” schools and will have the highest level of access, generally in accordance with applicable physical accessibility standards. Category 1A will provide “full accessibility” for the schools that were built to new construction standards, while Category 1B will provide “high accessibility” for schools that have been altered with some limited exceptions.
 
₋                     Category Two: These will be “program-accessible” schools. The core spaces and features of these schools would be made accessible; in addition, program accessibility would be provided to all programs and activities at the school. 
 
₋                     Category Three: These schools will have “core access,” which means that the core spaces (certain common spaces) would be made accessible, to ensure a basic level of access to the building. These include, for example, parking, the main entrance and main office, assembly areas, and some restrooms.
 
The five school sites for which an accessibility enhancement project is being proposed do not yet meet their assigned category/level of accessibility and thus require facilities improvements. The scope, schedule, and budget for each proposed project reflects the existing known conditions at each school site and the improvements necessary to meet each school’s assigned category of accessibility. The conditions of significance include acreage, topography, square footage, existence of multi-story buildings, age of buildings, as well as the number of schools, programs, features, and activities at a school site. 
 
A need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access classroom buildings at Cheremoya  ES and Ritter ES has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student’s need for programmatic access. These projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed “rapidly” with a project budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed barrier removal projects at Cheremoya ES and Ritter ES do not meet the parameters of the RAP due to their scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the project proposals to the Board for approval.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit D. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit E. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve five accessibility enhancement projects and two barrier removal projects, as detailed in Exhibits A and B, and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately begin designing the proposed projects at seven school sites.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the five proposed accessibility enhancement projects, which are necessary to achieve program accessibility as outlined in the Transition Plan, and the two barrier removal projects, which are required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal furthers the implementation of the Transition Plan. As outlined in the Transition Plan, at Category One, Two and Three schools, an appropriate number of classrooms will be identified to serve as accessible learning spaces, some of which may require facility improvements to meet the criteria for their assigned accessibility category. Additionally, the proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements at schools.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves. This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget, as currently estimated, for the seven proposed projects is $43,447,077. The proposed projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
The seven proposed projects will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 3,600 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at each campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability. As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible. While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities. These proposed projects are in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.
 
Cheremoya ES and Ritter ES have been assigned a Category Two accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing more robust scopes that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that providing three path of travel upgrades, one concrete ramp, one accessible gate, and two intercoms at Cheremoya ES and providing one path of travel upgrade, one restroom upgrade, one concrete ramp, three door hardware, two intercoms, and two miscellaneous upgrades at Ritter ES would provide students and staff direct access to the classroom buildings. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Five Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends the definition and approval of five Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan, for a combined budget of $700,000.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve five SEEDS Projects at Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School, Mulholland Middle School, Stoner Avenue Elementary School, Toland Way Elementary School, and Warner Elementary School (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000.
 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive, Chief Procurement Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed SEEDS Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The SEEDS Program supports the development of projects that will enhance school sites by creating outdoor learning spaces in collaboration with school-based and community-led efforts (Program). There are two components to the Program:
 
1.                     Development of the outdoor learning space constructed by Los Angeles Unified includes capital investments, such as asphalt removal, installation of irrigation and utilities, and any associated testing and inspection.
 
2.                     Collaboration with a school site and/or partner organization that will outfit the outdoor learning space with the plant materials and landscaping features that align with the school’s instructional vision and program. This component is essential to the success of each project.
 
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school site by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit a SEEDS application to receive up to $100,000 to create or improve an outdoor learning space. An additional $50,000 is available to schools ranked in the top 150 on the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index of schools in need of green space as published in August 2022 (Greening Index).
 
The Greening Index ranks the five schools as follows: Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School (619), Mulholland Middle School (577), Stoner Avenue Elementary School (91), Toland Way Elementary School (336), and Warner Elementary School (144). Therefore, Stoner Avenue Elementary School and Warner Elementary School are eligible for the additional $50,000 allocation.
 
District staff evaluates the proposals based on the specific criteria and requirements outlined in the SEEDS Program Guide to ensure each proposal meets the eligibility requirements. Proposals must include a written project narrative describing the project scope, an explanation of how the project will be integrated into the school’s curriculum, and confirmation of the availability of resources to outfit and maintain the outdoor learning space. The recommended Projects included in this Board Report have been reviewed and have been found to comply with the program requirements, including feasibility and equitable distribution throughout the District.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this proposed action will enable staff to proceed with the design and construction of these five proposed Projects. Approval of these greening Projects will improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff, increase sustainability, and enhance the outdoor school environment.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to execute these proposed Projects that support educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science. If these proposed projects are not approved, the school sites will not benefit from the creation of these outdoor learning spaces.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The action is also aligned with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 2 Joy and Wellness Welcoming Learning Environments by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined project budget for the five proposed Projects is $700,000. The Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
The combined project budget includes a contribution of $100,000 from Bond Program funds earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 4. This contribution will be transferred to funds earmarked in the School Upgrade Program (SUP) for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency. The breakdown of this contribution by project is shown in Exhibit A.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed SEEDS projects at Elysian Heights Arts Magnet Elementary School, Mulholland Middle School, Stoner Avenue Elementary School, Toland Way Elementary School, and Warner Elementary School will provide outdoor learning spaces that create environments for student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. These SEEDS learning gardens will facilitate educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science, and may also be used during recess and lunchtime by approximately 2,510 current and future students. These proposed Projects also encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces.
 
Equity Impact:
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit an application for a SEEDS project for up to $100,000. Schools ranked in the top 150 on the Greening Index will receive an additional $50,000 for their SEEDS project. Two of the five proposed projects included in this Board Report qualify for this additional funding.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In order to ensure the long-term permanence of each SEEDS project, the school site and/or its partner organization must enter into a Maintenance Agreement that provides for the ongoing maintenance of the proposed outdoor learning space.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Birmingham Community Charter High School Aquatic Facility Replacement Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a project to replace the outdoor swimming pool complex at Birmingham Community Charter High School (Board District 3), and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein, for a budget of $41,141,552.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the Birmingham Community Charter High School Aquatic Facility Replacement Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein.  The budget of the proposed Project is $41,141,552.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The School Upgrade Program (SUP) - the current phase of Los Angeles Unified’s Bond Program - supports the development of projects that upgrade, modernize, and replace aging and deteriorating school facilities, update technology, and address facilities inequities to help improve student health, safety, and educational quality.  The SUP includes a spending target entitled, “Charter School Facilities Upgrades and Expansions.”  Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP.
 
Charter school facilities upgrade projects developed under this category of need are subject to assessment of the conditions and needs of the school building/site systems and components of District facilities occupied by charter schools, input from the charter school community, and development of an implementation plan by District staff.  
 
The swimming pool complex at Birmingham Community Charter High School is in need of replacement due to continuous leakage from cracks found throughout the swimming pool and the pool deck, causing reduced water levels in the swimming pool and saturated soil behind the perimeter walls of the swimming pool complex.
 
The scope of the proposed Project includes, but is not limited to, the following:
 
•                     Construction of new outdoor swimming pool and associated support buildings as well as new shade structures, scoreboard, accessible bleachers, and sports lighting system with audio/visual system.
 
•                     Demolition of existing outdoor swimming pool complex, including support buildings and structures.
 
•                     Site improvements at former pool area, including new natural turf, landscaping, and irrigation. 
 
•                     Compliance with requirements from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Division of the State Architect (DSA), California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), or other obligations to ensure adherence with local, state, and federal requirements.
 
Construction is anticipated to begin in Q4-2027 and be completed in Q4-2029. The proposed Project will enhance physical education and athletics at Birmingham Community Charter High School and Daniel Pearl Magnet School - whose students participate in the aquatics program - and support California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) competitions for multiple West Valley schools including Taft Charter HS, Kennedy HS, Van Nuys HS, Granada Hills Charter, and El Camino Real Charter HS at the area’s only pool. The proposed Project contributes to student health, safety, athletic achievement, school pride, and a positive school culture.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on May 22, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A.  The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B.  Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.
 
The proposed Project, once completed, will support student athletic achievement and physical education programs. The proposed Project will also decrease demand for ongoing costly repairs and maintenance, ensure compliance with current codes and requirements of the CIF for competition pools, and improve student health and safety.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Project in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US.  If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and ongoing repair and maintenance costs to operate the pool will continue until it is no longer deemed usable.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal does not impact Los Angeles Unified policy.  The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures.  The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading athletic facilities. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the proposed Project is $41,141,552, and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for charter school facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
The budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions.  The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Project enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to improve facilities that help ensure thousands of current and future students are provided a safe environment that promotes physical education programs and student athletic achievement.
 
Equity Impact:
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff will implement all opportunities to minimize construction impacts on school operations and existing athletic programs. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with CEQA.

(Approval of the renaming of Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter) Recommends approval of renaming the school to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renaming of Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy consistent with BUL-5549.2 (Naming/ Renaming Schools, Buildings, and Fields). The school is located in Board District 4, Region North. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
In the Fall of 2024, the community of Reseda raised concerns with the current name of the school: Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter. School administrators and staff began to communicate with stakeholders about the possible formation of a renaming committee made up of students, staff, and teachers. In the Fall of 2024, the renaming committee began to have formal meetings and generated feedback and ideas for school names from different stakeholders.
 
The school community proposed a name change would avoid confusion of being considered as an independent charter school. New families have shared the word “charter” in the school’s name automatically causes families to assume that Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter is not part of the LAUSD district. This confusion has led families away from the school thinking that the school is not aligned with the guidelines and policies of the school district. 
 
The renaming committee proposed 2 school names for the community to vote on:  Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter (keep as is) or Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy. 
 
The school community realizes that changing the school’s name will support with attracting new families. The school will continue to successfully operate as a welcoming environment. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
The school and community voted to change the name Hesby Oaks Charter to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy. With the adoption of this report by the Los Angeles Unified Board of Education, Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy will become the new name of the school.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If a “Yes” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name will change to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy.
 
 
If a “No” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name of the school will remain Hesby Oaks Leadership Charter.
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no known budget impact at this time as signage changes are not required. Dropping Charter from the school’s name will not require any new signage, therefore there are no fiscal impacts associated with this board report. 
 
Student Impact:
Renaming the school to Hesby Oaks Leadership Academy would have a positive community impact. It was also the most voted name by the parent and student stakeholder group. Stakeholders strongly believe that this will encourage new families to enroll and eliminate the confusion of assuming the school is part of a charter organization. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

(Approval of the renaming of Boyle Heights Hida Solis Senior High School) Recommends approval of renaming of the school to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renaming of Boyle Heights Hilda Solis Senior HS to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex consistent with BUL-5549.2 (Naming/Renaming Schools, Buildings, and Fields). The school is located in Board District 2, Region East.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The school originally served the Boyle Heights community where it was co-located on a middle school site. The district decided to relocate the school onto the Hilda L. Solis campus at the end of the 2023-24 school year. The school brings a unique thread of STEM focus for students in the surrounding community. The school may now reach, beyond Boyle Heights and into the Eastside Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.  The proposed Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex reflects growth. There has been an effort to maintain the schools original name while weaving together both schools.  Under the new name the school is prepared to welcome students from a broader service to diverse communities in the greater Eastside Region. Additionally, to honor the Hilda L. Solis Learning Academy (previous campus name) and the fact that the school is part of a larger complex, which includes a learning center, the name was to retain the Hilda L. Solis as part of the name. Due to the Boyle Heights campus relocation; this move has given the school an opportunity to grow the vibrant STEM program. The campus will be a great place to increase enrollment while offering addition A-G courses on site. At the new location, the campus will have an opportunity to expand its robotics program. The renaming committee proposed 3 names: Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex, Jose M. Hernandez High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex and Ruben Salazar at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.   
 
Expected Outcomes:
The school and community voted to change the name Boyle Heights Hilda L. Solis Senior HS magnet to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If a “yes” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name will change to Eastside High School at Hilda Solis Learning Complex. 
 
If a “no” vote is rendered by the Board of Education, the name of the school will remain Boyle Heights Hilda Solis HS STEM Magnet which does not represent the present community. 
 
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no known budget impact at this time as signage changes are not required. Updating the school’s name will not require new signage. There will be no fiscal impact to the changing of the name from Boyle Heights Hilda Solis Senior HS to Eastside High School at Hilda L. Solis Learning Complex.
 
Student Impact:
Renaming the school would have a positive community impact. It was also the most voted name by the parent and student stakeholder group. Students feel a strong, positive connection, rather than the current name, which is not inclusive or representative of the present. 
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
None.

(Approval of Community Advisory Committee (CAC) Membership) Recommends approval of prospective members to serve on the District Community Advisory Committee, as required by the California Education Code, section 56191.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve those persons included in Attachment A for a term of membership on the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) for the identified terms of 2025-2027, and alternates to serve on the CAC for the 2025-2026 school year.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The CAC serves in an advisory capacity to the Board of Education and the Division of Special Education on the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).
 
The California Education Code, Section 56190-56193, requires each SELPA to establish a CAC to fulfill specific responsibilities. In addition, it requires that the members of the CAC be appointed by the Board of Education using selection procedures described in the SELPA Local Plan. CAC members serve a two-year term, which is staggered to ensure that no more than one half of the membership serves the first year of the term in any one year.
 
The CAC must be composed of the following: parents of individuals with exceptional needs enrolled in public or private schools (must serve as committee majority), parents of other students enrolled in school, students and adults with disabilities, regular education teachers, special education teachers, and other school personnel, representatives of other public and private agencies, and people concerned with the needs of individuals with exceptional needs. CAC bylaws also state that “CAC members must live, work, attend, or be the parent/guardian of a student attending a school within the LAUSD SELPA.”
 
For the last decade, prospective members of the CAC were identified through the ranking of applications, with an appointment committee assigning points to applications based on a rubric.  At parents' request last year for a more transparent process, the SELPA Local Plan language changed to allow for membership elections to occur in much the same way they transpire for other state-mandated District central committees identified in the California Education Code.  This year, vacancies for the seats of parents of students with exceptional needs were filled by in-person elections in each Region and online for the Virtual Academies.  The elections for special education students and special education teachers occurred online in the evening. The vacancies for the other categories of adult with disabilities, community members, community-based organizations, and alternate for the seat of parent of general education students were filled at an in-person election in a central location at the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement. 
 
Vacancies for membership on the CAC were advertised on KLCS and District websites; through special education parent trainings and bi-weekly Family Academy webinars; through LAUSD’s Department of Transition Services (DOTS) staff and Region special education teams; and emails, voice, and text messages sent to all Los Angeles Unified families and additionally to parents or guardians of students with exceptional needs. Membership vacancies were also advertised via flyers and announcements during CAC, PAC, and DELAC meetings; at Region Ambassador sessions and various Region workshops; through the Charter Division and the Office of Development and Civic Engagement; and sent directly to each Board of Education staff via email for distribution. The Division of Special Education and the Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement held 11 elections during April and one additional election in the month of May. The proposed persons being submitted for appointment to the CAC were elected by their peers, as required by the California Education Code. 
 
According to the California Education Code, Section 56194, the CAC addresses the responsibilities defined in the local plan as described below, including, but not limited to, all the following:
 
a.                     Advising the policy and administrative entity of the special education local plan area regarding
 the development, amendment, and review of the local plan. The entity shall  review and consider 
 comments from the community advisory committee.
b.                     Recommending annual priorities to be addressed by the plan.
c.                     Assisting in parent education and in recruiting parents and other volunteers who may contribute
 to the implementation of the plan.
d.                     Encouraging community involvement in the development and review of the local plan.
e.                     Supporting activities on behalf of individuals with exceptional needs.
f.                     Assisting in parent awareness of the importance of regular school attendance.
g.                     Supporting community involvement in the parent advisory committee established pursuant to
 Section 52063 to encourage the inclusion of parents of individuals with exceptional needs to the 
 extent these pupils also fall within one or more of the definitions in Section 42238.01”.
 
The Office of Student, Family, and Community Engagement and the Division of Special Education are requesting a motion by the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education to appoint members to the CAC, a state-mandated committee established to advise the Board of Education and the Division of Special Education on the SELPA Local Plan.
 
The individuals in Attachment A were elected by their peers at an in-person or virtual election. They are recommended to be the new representatives of the CAC for a two-year term, or as alternates for a one-year term. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval by the Board of Education of those persons whose names have been submitted for CAC membership will enable the CAC to remain compliant within the guidelines established in the California Education Code, Sections 56190-56194.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approving the requested membership will enable the CAC to continue fulfilling the responsibilities as defined in the California Education Code, Section 56194, and in the SELPA Local Plan for service. If not approved, the District will be out of compliance with state requirements, and sanctions may be issued.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action supports the Board’s initiative to enhance parent engagement and is aligned to the Strategic Plan Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration. There are no changes to the existing policies of the District through this action.
 
Budget Impact: 
None
 
Student Impact:
None

Issues and Analysis: 
California Education Code, Sections 56190-56194, sets forth state requirements for the selection and appointment of members for the CAC.

Approval of Procurement Actions

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” to include the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; Contract Assignments; and Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services: District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed on Attachment “B” ; and Certification of federal micro-purchase threshold for calendar years 2024/2025 as listed on Attachment “C.”
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Good and General Services:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts as listed in Attachment “B”; and Certify federal micro-purchase threshold for calendar years 2024/2025 as listed on Attachment “C.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the project approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; Contract Assignments; Purchase Orders; and
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request approval of Procurement Action not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and
•                     Goods and General Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contracts.
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See attached for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority.

end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Castlebay Lane Charter (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 701 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Castlebay Lane Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 651 students on a District facility at 19010 Castlebay Lane, Porter Ranch, 91326 in Board District 3 and Region North. Castlebay Lane Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 5, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 804 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Castlebay Lane Charter expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Castlebay Lane Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 357, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
As an affiliated charter school, Castlebay Lane Charter is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Dixie Canyon Community Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 622 students on a District site at 4220 Dixie Canyon Avenue, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91423 in Board District 3 and Region North. Dixie Canyon Community Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 752 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Dixie Canyon Community Charter expires June 30, 2025.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 422 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy.  The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies is a TK-5 school currently serving 368 students on a District site at 6624 Lockhurst Drive, West Hills, CA, 91307 in Board District 3 and Region North. Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 443 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 6, 2025, Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 4, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
 
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 360, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies is part of the District for purposes of special education.
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary (“Charter School”), located in Board District 3 and Region North, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2031, to serve to up 491 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. Please note, for all District affiliated charter schools, the District determines each school’s operational capacity annually in accordance with District policy.  The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 426 students on a District site at 6170 Lockhurst Drive, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 in Board District 3 and Region North. Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 540 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 363, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Lockhurst Drive Charter Elementary is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.

If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is likely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2025.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 365-24/25, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the Affiliated FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the Affiliated FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the Affiliated FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
As an affiliated charter school, Plainview Academic Charter Academy is part of the District for purposes of special education.
 
As an affiliated charter, all revenues generated by the school will be received by LAUSD. The District will allocate school resources in the same manner as it does a non-charter school except as otherwise specified in the statute and in applicable District policies.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda as consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies is a TK-5 school currently serving 511 students on a District site at 5014 Serrania Avenue, Woodland Hills, CA 91364 in Board District 4 and Region North. Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 12, 2012.  On May 9, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 715 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies expires June 30, 2025.
 
On March 5, 2025, Serrania Avenue Charter for Enriched Studies submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its affiliated charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through June 3, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on April 8, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition.

description
(Authorization of a Resolution of the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District Approving the Sales of a Previously Authorized Judgment Obligation Bonds, and Related Documents and Actions, including an Official Statement, Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Program) Recommends approval for the issuance of an additional series of Judgment Obligation Bonds to refund all or a portion of significant tort liability obligations from AB 218 and similar claims. The issuance of Additional JOBs is limited to the parameters included in the Board-approved Judgment Refunding Resolution. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the attached resolution (Attachment A) (the “Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution”) relating to the sales of additional series of judgment obligation bonds (the “Additional JOBs”) in accordance with the previously approved program to refund all or a portion of significant involuntary tort liability obligations arising as a result of litigation brought by application of California Assembly Bill Number 218 (“AB 218”) and similar childhood sexual assault, abuse and/or molestation claims for tort liability (the “Judgment Refunding Program”), and authorize the designated officers as described in the attached resolution.  The issuance of Additional JOBs is limited to the parameters included in the Board-approved Judgment Refunding Resolution (defined below).
end
 
Body
Background: 
On June 18, 2024, the Board approved the issuance of Judgment Obligation Notes, Judgment Obligation Bonds and a revolving line of credit as part of the Judgment Refunding Program to refund anticipated significant involuntary tort liability obligations arising as a result of litigation brought by application of AB 218 and similar claims for tort liability, as well as the judicial validation of such obligations (the “Judgment Refunding Resolution”).  Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Resolution, the Board has authorized the issuance of judgment obligation bonds from time to time subject to certain limitations contained therein, including the issuance of the Additional JOBs   
 
Pursuant to the Judgment Refunding Resolution, in June 2024, the District filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles seeking judicial confirmation of the validity of the transactions contemplated in the Judgment Refunding Resolution, including, without limitation, judgment obligation bonds and the execution and delivery of an Indenture, Supplemental Indentures, a Revolving Credit Agreement and related Promissory Notes.  The requested judgment in the validation action has been judicially approved and the period for appeals has now run.
 
 
The first issuance of judgment obligation bonds is intended to be completed in July 2025 in order to refund tort claims arising under AB 218, as well as refund certain tax and revenue anticipation notes issued to pay AB 218 tort claims while the validation action was pending. The Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution poises the District to be ready for subsequent sales of judgment obligation bonds as and when necessary, from time to time, under the Judgment Refunding Resolution, in order to refund tort liability obligations arising under AB 218 which continue to arise.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the Judgment Obligation Bond Resolution will authorize the sales of subsequent series of judgment obligation bonds already authorized to be issued under the Judgment Refunding Resolution.
 
Given the potential liability amounts likely to result from the AB 218 tort claims discussed above, payment of such obligations in full upon conclusion of the related litigation would result in significant impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in fiscal year 2025-26 and future fiscal years.  The Additional JOBs would be sold to refund the tort liability obligations and amortize the liability over time, therefore, lessening potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board not approve this item, staff will not proceed with additional sales of judgment obligation bonds to pay the tort claims discussed above. In such case, the liability resulting from the tort claims will generally be payable in full as and when the litigation with respect to each claim is concluded from any available moneys of the District. Depending on the timing and size of the liabilities, District budgetary resources may need to be shifted away from programs to pay such liabilities.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with the relevant criteria set forth in Article I, Article II Section 2.02, and Article IV Section 4.12 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Additional JOBs will be obligations of the District, payable from general fund balances and revenues. However, given the potential liability amounts likely to result from the tort claims discussed above, payment of such obligations in full upon conclusion of the related litigation would result in significant impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in fiscal year 2025-26 and future fiscal years. The Judgment Refunding Program, including sales of Additional JOBs, has been established to mitigate and manage these impacts by refunding the tort liability obligations and amortizing the liability over time, therefore, lessening any potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.
 
Student Impact:
Sales of the Additional JOBs will further the goals of the Judgment Refunding Program of mitigating and managing impacts to the District’s budgetary resources in the current and future fiscal years by refunding expected tort liability obligations and amortizing the liability over time, therefore, lessening any potential impacts to the District’s core education programs in the near term.
 
 
 
 
 
Equity Impact:
 



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

     4

The Judgment Refunding Program actively recognizes historical inequities by addressing the involuntary tort liability obligations arising from AB 218 and similar claims for tort liability. These obligations result from alleged misconduct by District personnel and have led to significant legal liabilities for the District.



Resource Prioritization

     4

The Judgment Refunding Program effectively prioritizes resources based on need. The program is designed to manage the significant financial impact of tort liability obligations on the District’s budget, thereby ensuring that resources can continue to be allocated effectively to meet the needs of students and the wider school community.  The Notes as a means of temporary finance is designed to manage the potential financial impact of the Involuntary Tort Claims on the District’s budget, thereby ensuring that resources can continue to be allocated effectively to meet the needs of students and the wider school community.



Results

     3

The Judgment Refunding Program is likely to result in closed opportunity gaps. By managing the financial impact of significant tort liability obligations, the program helps ensure that the District can continue to provide essential services and opportunities to students, particularly those from underserved communities.  The Notes, as an interim component to the Judgment Refunding Program, are likely to result in closed opportunity gaps. By managing the financial impact of potential tort liability obligations, application of the Note proceeds will help to ensure that the District can continue to provide essential services and opportunities to students, particularly those from underserved communities.



TOTAL

     11

 


 
Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the Judgment Obligation Bond Sales Resolution will enable the District to sell an additional series of judgment obligation bonds under the Judgment Refunding Program, which will help manage the financial impact of the tort liability obligations. Sales of the Additional JOBs will allow the District to spread the liability over time, mitigating the immediate financial impact.

end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

(Approve the Proposed Update of the Debt Management Policy)
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the proposed Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) set forth in Attachment A. Recommends approval of the proposed Debt Management Policy requires the District to review the Policy annually. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer proposes recommended changes for Board approval to provide formal guidance for prudent debt management within the District.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The District currently maintains certain financial policies, as prescribed by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) as “best practices”, including a Debt Management Policy.  These policies are critical to the District’s credit ratings, as they set forth the types of conservative budgeting, debt management, and investment practices that protect the fiscal integrity of the District.  
 
The Debt Management Policy establishes formal guidelines for the issuance of various types of debt instruments and other long-term financial obligations to assure prudent debt management. These guidelines also assist in the strategic planning for the District’s capital improvement projects.  
 
The Policy requires the District to review the Policy annually, with the Chief Financial Officer proposing any recommended changes to the Board.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Shall satisfy the requirement that any material changes to the Debt Management Policy be reviewed and approved by the Board, and shall maintain the District’s “best practices” in the area of debt management.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may approve the proposed Debt Management Policy that will incorporate the following recommended changes:
 
1)                     There were no changes to the District’s credit ratings in FY 2024-25.
 
2)                     Background: 
Original Text: The policies set forth in this Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) have been developed to provide guidelines for the issuance of general obligation bonds (“GO Bonds”), certificates of participation (“COPs”) and other lease-backed financings, tax and revenue anticipation notes (“TRANs”), and other forms of indebtedness by the Los Angeles Unified School District (the “District”). 
While the issuance of debt can be an appropriate method of financing capital projects or annual cash flow management, careful and consistent monitoring of such debt issuance is required to preserve the District’s credit strength and budgetary and financial flexibility.
 
Revised Text: The policies set forth in this Debt Management Policy (the “Policy”) have been developed to provide guidelines for the issuance of general obligation bonds (“GO Bonds”), certificates of participation  (“COPs”) and other lease-backed financings, tax and revenue anticipation notes (“TRANs”), and other forms of indebtedness. In 2024, the District approved the issuance of judgment obligation bonds and notes (“JOBs”) and a revolving credit facility (“RCA”) to assist it in prudently amortizing and/or restructuring its tort liabilities over time. While the issuance of debt can be an appropriate method of financing capital projects, extraordinary liabilities, and annual cash flow management, careful and consistent monitoring of such debt issuance is required to preserve the District’s credit strength and budgetary and financial flexibility. 
 
3)                     Article I. Purpose and Goals: Added the following text, “and other forms of indebtedness”
 
4)                     Section 2.02  Types of Debt Authorized to be Issued 
                      A.  Short-Term Debt: Added the following text, “Short-term notes including TRANs or RCAs may also be issued in conjunction with the District’s JOB program as described in Section 2.02 D below.”
 
                     D.  Judgment Obligation Bonds (“JOBs”): Added the following text, “JOBs may be used in conjunction with an RCA.  Prior to the issuance of JOBs, on an interim basis, involuntary tort indebtedness can be repaid through the issuance of notes under an RCA. When sufficient claims are accumulated under the RCA, JOBs would be issued that pay off the notes. In addition, prior to the issuance of JOBs, TRANs may also be issued to pay off involuntary tort liabilities on an interim basis.”
 
5)                     Section 2.04  Annual Review of Debt Policy 
                      Deleted the following sentence, “The Board is the obligated issuer of all District debt and awards all purchase contracts for bonds, COPs/LRBs, TRANs, and any other debt issuances.”
 
6)                     Section 3.01 Structure of Debt Issues: 
                      Maturity of Debt: Added the following text, “for capital projects” 
 
                          Added sub-section 3.01A(iv): “Judgement Obligation Bonds:  The Board has authorized JOBs to be amortized for up to 20 years.   This amortization period will enable the District to mitigate and manage the impact of large tort liabilities on its budgetary resources.”
7)                     Section 3.07 Debt Issued to Finance Operating Costs: Added the following text, “however may be paid from any moneys of the District lawfully available”
 
8)                     Section 3.08  Credit Rating Methodologies and Debt Burden Ratios
i)                     Subsection B (iv) changes:  
(1)                     Variable-Rate COPs Issues was changed to Variable-Rate Debt. “Portfolio of COPs/LRBs was changed to “debt portfolio”.
(2)                     Added the following text, “However, the District may use variable rate interim financing above this limit where the intent is to refund the interim financing with fixed-rate financing within 13 months and the variable rate issuance is necessary to facilitate the refinancing.”
 
ii)                     Subsection D changes: Table 2 (Debt Burden Ratio) was removed. Moody’s no longer provides                      the information.  
 
The Board may prefer not to adopt the revised Policy and have the current Policy remain in effect.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is in compliance with Section 2.04 of the Debt Management Policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
No budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
The Debt Management Policy ensures that debt issuance is done in a fiscally prudent manner, which in turn minimizes the cost to the General Fund and maximizes the funds available for educating students.
 
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

      2

The Debt Management Policy vaguely recognizes historical inequities.



Resource Prioritization

      4

One of the policy objectives listed in Article I, Purpose and Goals, of the Debt Management Policy, specifies that when projects are selected to be financed by bond proceeds, these projects support the district’s future needs and goals. This objective effectively prioritizes resources based on student needs.



Results

      3

The Debt Management Policy is intended to provide guidelines for the issuance of debt, as a method of financing capital projects. These projects prioritize student needs, especially in communities that have experienced historical inequities, which may result in closing opportunity gaps and/or achievement gaps.

(Application for Exemption from the Required Expenditures for Classroom Teachers’ Salaries) Recommends the Board of Education authorize staff to submit an application for exemption from the required expenditures for classroom teachers’ salaries for Fiscal Year 2023-24.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize staff to submit an application for exemption from the required expenditures for salaries of classroom teachers for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 (enclosed herewith as “Attachment A”) to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE).  
end
 
Body
Background: 
California Education Code (EC) Section 41372 requires unified school districts expend at least 55% of their current expense of education for “salaries of classroom teachers” as evidenced by the unaudited actual expenditures. Based on Los Angeles Unified’s 2023-2024 Unaudited Actual Expenditures, staff is proposing the Board of Education (Board) authorize the submittal of an application for exemption from this requirement as provided by law.  Current expense of education includes the gross total expended for:
•                     Certificated salaries other than certificated salaries for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
•                     Classified salaries other than classified salaries for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
•                     Employee benefits other than employee benefits for pupil transportation personnel, food services personnel, and community services personnel
•                     Books, supplies, and equipment replacement other than for pupil transportation and food services
•                     Community services, contracted services, and other operating expenses other than for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
 
Eligible classroom expenses must be from the general fund (unrestricted and restricted) and determined by a job code established by the California Department of Education (i.e., California School Accounting Manual). The job code must begin with an 11 or 21 and includes:
•                     General Education Teacher
•                     Special Day teachers and Resource Teacher
•                     Contract Pool Teacher
•                     Adaptive PE Teacher
•                     Arts Itinerant
 
 
•                     Instructional Coach
•                     Teacher Assistant, Special Education Assistant, Intervention Aide, Speech Pathology Aide
•                     Substitute time, additional time, overtime, and benefits for the above jobs
 
Pursuant to EC Section 41372, “current expense of education” does not include expenditures: 
•                     Classified as sites, buildings, books, and media and new equipment (object of expenditure 6000 of the California School Accounting Manual)
•                     From categorical aid received from the federal or state government which funds were granted for expenditures in a program not incurring any teacher salary expenditures or requiring disbursement of the funds without regard to the requirements of EC Section 41372
•                     For facility acquisition and construction
•                     Pursuant to any lease agreement for plant and equipment 
 
The positions or items that are not considered classroom expenditures (job codes that do not begin with an 11 or 21) are categories such as:
•                     Librarian
•                     Interventionist
•                     Speech Pathologist
•                     Counselor
•                     Psychologist
•                     Psychiatric Social Worker 
•                     Pupil Services Attendance Counselor
•                     School Nurse
•                     School Administrator
•                     Library Aide
•                     Non-General Fund Teachers and Aides, such as:
o                     Adult Education Teacher 
o                     Early Education Center Teacher and Aide
•                     Classroom supplies or textbooks
•                     Other non-labor expenditures at school sites
 
During the pandemic, the District received an unprecedented infusion of COVID-19 relief grant dollars to support student learning and recovery and based on the calculations at that time for the 2023-24 fiscal year, it resulted in a threshold of 47%. The 7.9% shortfall from meeting the 55% equates to a $764 million shortfall. Recently, LACOE brought to our attention that Los Angeles Unified had inaccurately categorized some of the COVID-19 grant dollars received as a “current expense of education” for the 2023-24 fiscal year. As an example, mental health and school nursing programs funded with ESSER should have been excluded from the current expense of education since these were restricted programs with no teacher expense.  If the correct calculation had been used, the District would have met the requirement at 58.3%. Despite this revelation, due to the compulsory nature of the accounting standards, Los Angeles Unified is unable to retroactively correct its FY 2023-24 financials and thus a waiver is required.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon authorization by the Board, staff will submit the application for exemption to the County Superintendent of schools for review, and approval or denial. 
 
If the Board does not authorize staff to file the exemption, the County Superintendent may direct the identified deficiency of $764 million be designated and restricted for eligible classroom expenses in the current fiscal year or the next fiscal year given that the current fiscal year ends in less than 30 days. Meaning, $764 million in the current 2024-25 budget or proposed 2025-26 budget will have to be redirected from priority programs. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may authorize District staff to submit the application for exemption from the required expenditures for classroom teachers’ salaries, based on the hardship that would have been caused if the District were required to meet the 55% threshold for fiscal year 2023-24 under the circumstances. Assuming the exemption is granted, the District will not have additional restrictions placed on certain funds in the current or next fiscal year.
 
If the Board does not authorize, the District shall not apply for the exemption. In the absence of a Board approved exemption, the County Superintendent of School will order the $764 million to be added to the amounts to be expended for salaries of classroom teachers in the current fiscal year or the next fiscal year given that the current fiscal year ends in less than 30 days. This would have a significant impact on the amounts budgeted or proposed to be budgeted for specific investment strategies in the current fiscal year. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Submission of the District’s 2023-24 Current Expense of Education (CEA) Actuals exemption request shall comply with the Education Code and LACOE requirements.
 
Budget Impact: 
With LACOE’s approval of the exemption, the District shall be able to operate based on the proposed budget for FY 2025-26 and maintain reserves at the required statutory level, including maintaining the funding appropriated for investment strategies. Without the approval of exemption, the District will need to review its spending priorities and reallocate program funding to meet the requirements of EC 41372. 
 
Student Impact:
The District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.
 
Equity Impact:
 



Component

  Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

     2

Classroom expenses cover a wide range of spending that ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities.”



Resource Prioritization

     2

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.



Results

     2

Resources are allocated to the extent that it would support student needs, address priorities of achieving the District goals.

Issues and Analysis: 
As mentioned above, LACOE recently brought to our attention that Los Angeles Unified had inaccurately categorized some of the COVID-19 grant dollars received in the 2023-24 budget. Since then, staff members have received training and corrected the calculations. However, due to the compulsory nature of the accounting standards, Los Angeles Unified is unable to retroactively correct its FY 2023-24 financials and thus a waiver request is necessary.
 
If the Board authorizes staff to submit the exemption request, FY 2023-24 would mark the fourth consecutive year the District has filed this exemption request, since the inception of COVID-19 relief grant dollars. However, based on LACOE’s recent clarification on how to properly calculate the current expense of education, Los Angeles Unified would have met or exceeded the 55% expenditure requirement for salaries of classroom teachers. As of second interim for the current year (FY25), Los Angeles Unified is on track to meet the 55% rate with a current rate of 58.8%. The FY25 rate will be finalized upon completion of the annual audit to be presented in the winter.

description
Whereas, Sport, play, and movement are essential for positive youth development, improving mental and physical health, increasing cognitive performance, building self-esteem, cultivating leadership skills, and contributing to higher academic and career achievement;
 
Whereas, Inequities in access to sport, play, and movement exist, particularly for Black and Latino children, youth with disabilities, and those from low-income households, who often face barriers such as limited access to green spaces, high costs, inadequate facilities, and lower rates of participation in organized sports; 
 
Whereas, According to the 2024 California Play Equity Report, commissioned by the LA84 Foundation, 66 percent of youth are not meeting federal recommendations for daily physical activity, with the lowest participation rates among Latinas, Black and African American girls, Latino youth, youth with disabilities, and youth from households earning $50,000 or less;
 
Whereas, Achieving play equity means removing barriers and ensuring access to sport, play, and movement for all children. This is essential to fostering lifelong well-being, promoting social and emotional growth, and realizing a more just and inclusive society;
 
Whereas, The LA84 Foundation and the Play Equity Fund have issued a call to action through Play Day on June 28, 2025, a national celebration uplifting the joy and benefits of sport, play, and movement in the neighborhoods where children live;
 
Whereas, Play Day 2025 will be celebrated with a Block Party at the LA84 Foundation headquarters in West Adams, featuring music, art, sports, and food to honor the legacy of the 1984 Olympic Games. One hundred additional satellite sites across the country will promote the joy of play and the power of community connection;
 
Whereas, Play Day exemplifies our shared commitment to building community, supporting equitable youth sports access, and creating healthy environments for all children to thrive;
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District's Strategic Plan 2022-2026 prioritizes joyful, safe, and healthy learning environments, recognizing that physical activity is essential to student success and holistic well-being; and
 
Whereas, The District has a long-standing commitment to student health and wellness, as demonstrated through its support of International Walk to School Day (October 9, 2013) and TV Turnoff Week (April 19-25, 2004), and recognizes the need to continue expanding inclusive access to physical activity; now, therefore, be it
 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms its commitment to closing the play equity gap and championing policies and practices that ensure all students have access to the lifelong benefits of sport, play, and movement;
 
Resolved further, That the Board designates June 28, 2025, as “Play Day” and encourages all Los Angeles Unified School District students, families, and staff to join the celebration in West Adams or participate in community play wherever they are that day; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to utilize and promote resources through the District’s Summer of Learning summer school programming, as well as Los Angeles County, and Los Angeles City, and other city programs within the Los Angeles Unified School District’s jurisdiction, such as Southeast Los Angeles cities and others, to support Play Day on June 28, 2025, and to champion equitable access to sports, play, and movement opportunities for all students throughout the year.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) has made a long-term investment in the Community Schools Initiative (CSI), implementing a holistic, student-centered model that supports student success by addressing academic, social, emotional, and community needs;
 
Whereas, The District’s commitment to CSI has been reaffirmed through a series of Board resolutions including Res-098-16/17, Res-045-19/20, and Res-031-20/21, and aligns with the District’s Strategic Plan, particularly Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, which prioritizes social-emotional learning, mental health, and safe school environments, and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, which emphasizes authentic family and community partnerships;
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District’s resolution “Sustaining, Deepening, and Expanding the District’s Community Schools Initiative” (Res-031-20/21) directed the District to expand the CSI by investing $10 million annually and growing the cohort of Community Schools by 10 schools each year between 2022-2025, while allocating an additional $2 million annually to support project management, coaching, evaluation, and technical assistance;
 
Whereas, The success of the Community Schools Initiative relies on a clear funding structure and strong infrastructure that support whole-school transformation and student achievement by coordinating assets across the District in multiple areas, such as mental health, family engagement, school climate, and instructional quality;
 
Whereas, The Community Schools Initiative has accelerated academic growth, with Cohort 1 students increasing proficiency in both English and math and expanding Advanced Placement enrollment between 2018-19 and 2021-22, while similar schools declined. These schools serve 90 percent of students in poverty, 77 percent Latino students, 13 percent Black students, 27 percent English learners, and 18 percent students with disabilities - demonstrating the model’s impact in improving outcomes for the District’s most underserved communities;
 
Whereas, Since its the inception, of the Community Schools Initiative, has operated with a dedicated cost center structure, enabling transparent tracking of funds and coordination across divisions which has supported the Initiative’s holistic, multi-tiered approach to student success, District funds were directly assigned to a Community Schools Initiative program code, enabling clear financial tracking, accountability, and alignment with CSI’s objective to coordinate across divisions to support its holistic, multi-tiered approach to student success; and the Division of Instruction is currently administering all District-allocated funding for the Community Schools Initiative, while the existing Community Schools Initiative program code is limited to managing external grant funds;
 
Whereas, The Community Schools Initiative is based on collaborative governance and shared leadership, with meaningful roles for school staff, families, students, and community partners in identifying priorities and shaping implementation through ongoing engagement and site-based decision-making; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms its commitment to sustaining, deepening, and expanding the Community Schools Initiative as outlined in Res-031-20/21;
 
Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to the Community Schools Initiative and directs the Superintendent to maintain a dedicated CSI cost center, distinct from any single division, to ensure transparency, protect the cross-divisional nature of the Initiative, and support its continued implementation and expansion;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall ensure that all District-allocated funding for the Community Schools Initiative - including funding to support central infrastructure such as staffing, coaching, technical assistance, and implementation support - is budgeted through the existing Community Schools Initiative program code to promote fiscal transparency, enable oversight, and support coordinated implementation across divisions; 
 
Resolved further, That this funding structure shall be used to support CSI implementation across the District’s divisions, including but not limited to instruction, student mental health and wellness, school climate, restorative practices, family engagement, and evaluation;
 
Resolved further, That the Board commits to the continued implementation, expansion, and sustainability of the Community Schools Initiative by ensuring ongoing funding and support for both school-site capacity and central infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to, a full-time Director, Community School Coaches, Community School Coordinators, support staff, and systems for professional learning, technical assistance, and continuous improvement necessary to uphold a high-quality, district-wide model;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall provide an annual report to the Board that includes input from the Community Schools Steering Committee and itemizes all CSI expenditures by function and division;
 
Resolved further, That the District and the Community Schools Steering Committee collaborate on assessing school sites, funding sources, and necessary infrastructure for future cohorts, and report back to the Board by end of the 2025-2026 school year; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall not reconfigure the CSI infrastructure or staffing without Board approval and shall continue to pursue additional funding from the State of California and philanthropic sources to sustain and scale the Community Schools model District-wide.",,,,,,,,

(Adoption of the 2025-26 Fiscal Stabilization Plan) Recommends adoption of the 2025-26 Fiscal Stabilization Plan as required by the Los Angeles County Office of Education to address the District’s qualified budget status as stated in the 2025-26 proposed budget.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed:
Adoption of 2025-26 Fiscal Stabilization Plan (FSP), as shown in Attachment A, to address the District’s proposed budget with a qualified budget status as required by the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) in their oversight function for the state.
end
Body
Background: 
LA Unified currently has a structural deficit whereby in-year expenditures exceed in-year revenues.  As revenues continue to decrease due to enrollment decline and loss of one-time COVID funds, expenditures have not been reduced proportionately.  The 2025-26 proposed budget includes the drawdown of one-time fund balance over the multi-year projection due to continued deficit spending.  The proposed budget includes a projected deficit of $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year (FY) 2027-28 of operating funds which indicates a lack of going concern.  On April 15, 2025, LACOE requested that LA Unified address its deficit spending through the submission of a Board-approved FSP. The FSP must identify specific expenditure reductions and/or revenue enhancements with associated cost savings and timelines to balance the budget prior to FY 27-28. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Adoption of the 2025-26 FSP, which outlines LA Unified’s plan to address its projected $1.6 billion deficit for Fiscal Year 2027-28, in compliance with LACOE’s oversight responsibility on behalf of the state.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board adopt the FSP, LA Unified will commence implementation to address its projected deficit spending. Reductions outlined in the FSP are expected to begin in FY 2026-27 and continue through FY 2027-28. During FY 2025-26, staff will outline specific action steps to implement the FSP and update the Board of its progress at each interim projection. Pending updates at the interim projections, amendments to the FSP may be proposed to the Board.  
 
If the Board does not adopt the proposal, the FSP will not be implemented, and LA Unified will report a negative unrestricted unassigned ending balance in FY 2027-28.  As a result, LACOE will issue a conditional approval of the District’s 2025-26 Final Budget and require an FSP with their oversight and approval. Conditional approval means that the County Superintendent may approve the District’s 2025-26 Final Budget on the condition that it take specific actions to remedy deficiencies in the multi-year projections. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Adoption of the Fiscal Stabilization Plan shall comply with LACOE’s oversight responsibility on behalf of the state.
 
Budget Impact: 
Adoption of the 2025-26 Fiscal Stabilization Plan, which if implemented as proposed over the next three years, will fully address LA Unified’s projected $1.6 billion deficit. 
 
Student Impact:
Adherence to LACOE’s oversight responsibility ensures that LA Unified shall continue to operate and serve its student population responsibly.

Issues and Analysis: 
The proposed FSP includes the reduction of the Board of Education approved Fund 17 by 10% (approximately $50 million) in the 2026-27 Fiscal Year.  As noted above, during FY 2025-26, staff will outline specific action steps to implement the FSP and update the Board of its progress at each interim projection. If, based on 2025-26 interim projections, the proposed reduction to Fund 17 continues to be necessary to address the District’s projected $1.6 billion deficit, a resolution for adoption will be presented to the Board to transfer funds from Fund 17 to the General Fund.

(Application for Exemption from the Required Expenditures for Classroom Teachers’ Salaries) Recommends the Board of Education authorize staff to submit an application for exemption from the required expenditures for classroom teachers’ salaries for Fiscal Year 2023-24.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize staff to submit an application for exemption from the required expenditures for salaries of classroom teachers for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 (enclosed herewith as “Attachment A”) to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE).  
end
 
Body
Background: 
California Education Code (EC) Section 41372 requires unified school districts expend at least 55% of their current expense of education for “salaries of classroom teachers” as evidenced by the unaudited actual expenditures. Based on Los Angeles Unified’s 2023-2024 Unaudited Actual Expenditures, staff is proposing the Board of Education (Board) authorize the submittal of an application for exemption from this requirement as provided by law.  Current expense of education includes the gross total expended for:
•                     Certificated salaries other than certificated salaries for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
•                     Classified salaries other than classified salaries for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
•                     Employee benefits other than employee benefits for pupil transportation personnel, food services personnel, and community services personnel
•                     Books, supplies, and equipment replacement other than for pupil transportation and food services
•                     Community services, contracted services, and other operating expenses other than for pupil transportation, food services, and community services
 
Eligible classroom expenses must be from the general fund (unrestricted and restricted) and determined by a job code established by the California Department of Education (i.e., California School Accounting Manual). The job code must begin with an 11 or 21 and includes:
•                     General Education Teacher
•                     Special Day teachers and Resource Teacher
•                     Contract Pool Teacher
•                     Adaptive PE Teacher
•                     Arts Itinerant
 
 
•                     Instructional Coach
•                     Teacher Assistant, Special Education Assistant, Intervention Aide, Speech Pathology Aide
•                     Substitute time, additional time, overtime, and benefits for the above jobs
 
Pursuant to EC Section 41372, “current expense of education” does not include expenditures: 
•                     Classified as sites, buildings, books, and media and new equipment (object of expenditure 6000 of the California School Accounting Manual)
•                     From categorical aid received from the federal or state government which funds were granted for expenditures in a program not incurring any teacher salary expenditures or requiring disbursement of the funds without regard to the requirements of EC Section 41372
•                     For facility acquisition and construction
•                     Pursuant to any lease agreement for plant and equipment 
 
The positions or items that are not considered classroom expenditures (job codes that do not begin with an 11 or 21) are categories such as:
•                     Librarian
•                     Interventionist
•                     Speech Pathologist
•                     Counselor
•                     Psychologist
•                     Psychiatric Social Worker 
•                     Pupil Services Attendance Counselor
•                     School Nurse
•                     School Administrator
•                     Library Aide
•                     Non-General Fund Teachers and Aides, such as:
o                     Adult Education Teacher 
o                     Early Education Center Teacher and Aide
•                     Classroom supplies or textbooks
•                     Other non-labor expenditures at school sites
 
During the pandemic, the District received an unprecedented infusion of COVID-19 relief grant dollars to support student learning and recovery and based on the calculations at that time for the 2023-24 fiscal year, it resulted in a threshold of 47%. The 7.9% shortfall from meeting the 55% equates to a $764 million shortfall. Recently, LACOE brought to our attention that Los Angeles Unified had inaccurately categorized some of the COVID-19 grant dollars received as a “current expense of education” for the 2023-24 fiscal year. As an example, mental health and school nursing programs funded with ESSER should have been excluded from the current expense of education since these were restricted programs with no teacher expense.  If the correct calculation had been used, the District would have met the requirement at 58.3%. Despite this revelation, due to the compulsory nature of the accounting standards, Los Angeles Unified is unable to retroactively correct its FY 2023-24 financials and thus a waiver is required.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon authorization by the Board, staff will submit the application for exemption to the County Superintendent of schools for review, and approval or denial. 
 
If the Board does not authorize staff to file the exemption, the County Superintendent may direct the identified deficiency of $764 million be designated and restricted for eligible classroom expenses in the current fiscal year or the next fiscal year given that the current fiscal year ends in less than 30 days. Meaning, $764 million in the current 2024-25 budget or proposed 2025-26 budget will have to be redirected from priority programs. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may authorize District staff to submit the application for exemption from the required expenditures for classroom teachers’ salaries, based on the hardship that would have been caused if the District were required to meet the 55% threshold for fiscal year 2023-24 under the circumstances. Assuming the exemption is granted, the District will not have additional restrictions placed on certain funds in the current or next fiscal year.
 
If the Board does not authorize, the District shall not apply for the exemption. In the absence of a Board approved exemption, the County Superintendent of School will order the $764 million to be added to the amounts to be expended for salaries of classroom teachers in the current fiscal year or the next fiscal year given that the current fiscal year ends in less than 30 days. This would have a significant impact on the amounts budgeted or proposed to be budgeted for specific investment strategies in the current fiscal year. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Submission of the District’s 2023-24 Current Expense of Education (CEA) Actuals exemption request shall comply with the Education Code and LACOE requirements.
 
Budget Impact: 
With LACOE’s approval of the exemption, the District shall be able to operate based on the proposed budget for FY 2025-26 and maintain reserves at the required statutory level, including maintaining the funding appropriated for investment strategies. Without the approval of exemption, the District will need to review its spending priorities and reallocate program funding to meet the requirements of EC 41372. 
 
Student Impact:
The District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.

Score Rationale



Recognition

     2

Classroom expenses cover a wide range of spending that ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities.”



Resource Prioritization

     2

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.



Results

     2

Resources are allocated to the extent that it would support student needs, address priorities of achieving the District goals.

Issues and Analysis: 
As mentioned above, LACOE recently brought to our attention that Los Angeles Unified had inaccurately categorized some of the COVID-19 grant dollars received in the 2023-24 budget. Since then, staff members have received training and corrected the calculations. However, due to the compulsory nature of the accounting standards, Los Angeles Unified is unable to retroactively correct its FY 2023-24 financials and thus a waiver request is necessary.
 
If the Board authorizes staff to submit the exemption request, FY 2023-24 would mark the fourth consecutive year the District has filed this exemption request, since the inception of COVID-19 relief grant dollars. However, based on LACOE’s recent clarification on how to properly calculate the current expense of education, Los Angeles Unified would have met or exceeded the 55% expenditure requirement for salaries of classroom teachers. As of second interim for the current year (FY25), Los Angeles Unified is on track to meet the 55% rate with a current rate of 58.8%. The FY25 rate will be finalized upon completion of the annual audit to be presented in the winter.

description
(Submission of 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Categorical Aid Programs) Recommends approval of the FY 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Funding Categorical Aid Programs so that the Superintendent’s FY2025-26 Budget can reflect the estimated total entitlement of $439.2 million across Titles I, II, III, and IV.
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorization to submit the 2025-26 Consolidated Application for Funding Categorical Aid Programs to the California Department of Education (CDE) and that the estimated entitlement amount for programs in the Consolidated Application be included in the Superintendent’s 2025-26 Budget.

Body
Background: 
The Consolidated Application has become a multi-part data collection with multiple due dates throughout the year. The Consolidated Application and Reporting System (CARS) Data Collection Schedules are as follows:
 
2025-2026 CARS Spring Data Collection - certification due 08/15/2025.
 
2025-2026 CARS Winter Data Collection - certification due 02/15/2026.
 
The Consolidated Application will continue to collect the following information: applications for federal funding, legal assurances, categorical program budget and expenditure reports, and categorical program activity reports.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of the FY 2025-26 Consolidated Application will allow the district to file multiple Consolidated Application Data Collections with the California Department of Education.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A consequence of not submitting the application is the elimination of supplemental programs that provide direct services. The impact will be an estimated loss of more than $439.2 million dollars for the 25-26 fiscal year. Central offices and school sites that receive funding through the Consolidated Application (across Titles I-IV) will need to look at other sources of funding for budgeted positions and expenditures for the 25-26 fiscal year.
 
Policy Implications: 
No District policy will be changed by approval of this action.
 
Budget Impact: 
The estimated entitlement amount of $439.2 million in federal programs includes the following:

Student Impact:
The federal formula grant funds have a direct impact on students, their teachers, and their parents. 
•                     Title I, Part A (Socioeconomically Disadvantaged) $375,256,523
funds provide instructional supports and interventions for at-risk, homeless, and neglected students, and pay for supplemental instructional materials, parent engagement activities, curricular trips, and equipment such as computers and projectors for instructional use. Title I, Part A funds also support the funding of supplemental positions such as teachers, counselors, psychologists, teacher assistants, coordinators, instructional coaches, community reps for parent engagement, etc. 
 
•                     Title I, Part A and Title II, Part A (Effective Teachers and Leaders) $27,283,285
funds support professional development for teachers, support staff, and instructional leaders. Title II funds are also used to support induction programs for beginning teachers, teaching and administrative credentials, the professional learning network, and the district’s teacher and administrator evaluation processes.
 
•                     Title III, Part A (English Learners) $10,029,250
funds provide professional development to teachers and school leaders. English Learner Coaches, newcomer programs, and other instructional supports for English Learners and immigrants are provided through these funds.
 
•                     Title IV, Part A (Student Support and Academic Enrichment) $26,665,280
funds provide programs to support a well-rounded education, including but not limited to professional development on STEAM, Secondary Math, Elementary English Language Arts, and college and career readiness. This program also supports safe and healthy schools through professional development, materials, and direct services. Title IV also supports effective integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
 
Equity Impact:



Component

Score

Rationale



Recognition

    3

The funds allocated via the Consolidated Application are formula-funded grants that are heavily based upon the number of children in low-income families (Title I, II, and IV) or the number of English Language Learners (Title III).



Resource Prioritization

    3

Resources (i.e., Title I and III) allocated to schools are based upon the needs of students and are described in the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). For all funds received through the Consolidated Application that are centrally administered, schools are prioritized to receive services based on need, e.g., if they are identified by the state’s accountability system, or other data.



Results

    3

Implementation of an evidence-based program is required for Title I funds allocated to schools.

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) has made a long-term investment in the Community Schools Initiative (CSI), implementing a holistic, student-centered model that supports student success by addressing academic, social, emotional, and community needs;
 
Whereas, The District’s commitment to CSI has been reaffirmed through a series of Board resolutions including Res-098-16/17, Res-045-19/20, and Res-031-20/21, and aligns with the District’s Strategic Plan, particularly Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, which prioritizes social-emotional learning, mental health, and safe school environments, and Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration, which emphasizes authentic family and community partnerships;
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District’s resolution “Sustaining, Deepening, and Expanding the District’s Community Schools Initiative” (Res-031-20/21) directed the District to expand the CSI by investing $10 million annually and growing the cohort of Community Schools by 10 schools each year between 2022-2025, while allocating an additional $2 million annually to support project management, coaching, evaluation, and technical assistance;
 
Whereas, The success of the Community Schools Initiative relies on a clear funding structure and strong infrastructure that support whole-school transformation and student achievement by coordinating assets across the District in multiple areas, such as mental health, family engagement, school climate, and instructional quality;
 
Whereas, The Community Schools Initiative has accelerated academic growth, with Cohort 1 students increasing proficiency in both English and math and expanding Advanced Placement enrollment between 2018-19 and 2021-22, while similar schools declined. These schools serve 90 percent of students in poverty, 77 percent Latino students, 13 percent Black students, 27 percent English learners, and 18 percent students with disabilities - demonstrating the model’s impact in improving outcomes for the District’s most underserved communities;
 
Whereas, Since its the inception, of the Community Schools Initiative, has operated with a dedicated cost center structure, enabling transparent tracking of funds and coordination across divisions which has supported the Initiative’s holistic, multi-tiered approach to student success, District funds were directly assigned to a Community Schools Initiative program code, enabling clear financial tracking, accountability, and alignment with CSI’s objective to coordinate across divisions to support its holistic, multi-tiered approach to student success; and the Division of Instruction is currently administering all District-allocated funding for the Community Schools Initiative, while the existing Community Schools Initiative program code is limited to managing external grant funds;
 
Whereas, The Community Schools Initiative is based on collaborative governance and shared leadership, with meaningful roles for school staff, families, students, and community partners in identifying priorities and shaping implementation through ongoing engagement and site-based decision-making; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms its commitment to sustaining, deepening, and expanding the Community Schools Initiative as outlined in Res-031-20/21;
 
Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to the Community Schools Initiative and directs the Superintendent to maintain a dedicated CSI cost center, distinct from any single division, to ensure transparency, protect the cross-divisional nature of the Initiative, and support its continued implementation and expansion;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall ensure that all District-allocated funding for the Community Schools Initiative - including funding to support central infrastructure such as staffing, coaching, technical assistance, and implementation support - is budgeted through the existing Community Schools Initiative program code to promote fiscal transparency, enable oversight, and support coordinated implementation across divisions; 
 
Resolved further, That this funding structure shall be used to support CSI implementation across the District’s divisions, including but not limited to instruction, student mental health and wellness, school climate, restorative practices, family engagement, and evaluation;
 
Resolved further, That the Board commits to the continued implementation, expansion, and sustainability of the Community Schools Initiative by ensuring ongoing funding and support for both school-site capacity and central infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to, a full-time Director, Community School Coaches, Community School Coordinators, support staff, and systems for professional learning, technical assistance, and continuous improvement necessary to uphold a high-quality, district-wide model;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall provide an annual report to the Board that includes input from the Community Schools Steering Committee and itemizes all CSI expenditures by function and division;
 
Resolved further, That the District and the Community Schools Steering Committee collaborate on assessing school sites, funding sources, and necessary infrastructure for future cohorts, and report back to the Board by end of the 2025-2026 school year; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall not reconfigure the CSI infrastructure or staffing without Board approval and shall continue to pursue additional funding from the State of California and philanthropic sources to sustain and scale the Community Schools model District-wide.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to celebrating the diverse backgrounds and identities present in our schools as a means of disrupting the generational, systemic manifestations of discrimination, racism, and bigotry affecting our communities;
 
Whereas, Pillar 2 of the District’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan focused on Joy and Wellness describes its commitment to designing and sustaining welcoming, safe, environmentally friendly, affirming, and inclusive learning environments for all students, staff, and employees; 
 
Whereas, According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 24% of high school students in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, gender nonconforming, and gender fluid (LGBTQ+);
 
Whereas, LGBTQ+ youth face significantly elevated mental health risks compared to their non-LGBTQ+ peers, due largely to stigma, discrimination, and lack of social support. CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) found that 69% of LGBTQ+ students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, compared to 35% of heterosexual students. Tragically, LGBTQ+ youth were more than twice as likely to attempt suicide compared to their heterosexual peers;
 
Whereas, In June 2023, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) passed Res-024-22/23 entitled, “Taking PRIDE in LA Unified’s LGBTQ+ Community” aimed at fostering an inclusive, affirming, and safe environment for LGBTQ+ students, staff, and families; and
 
Whereas, In November 2024, The Board passed Res-035-24/25 entitled, “Affirms that LAUSD Will Remain an Inclusive, Safe, and Welcoming Environment for All” which called on the District to protect and defend students, families, and staff from the harm intended by Project 2025 which posed a serious threat to LGBTQ+ students and staff; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (Board) hereby proclaims and commemorates June 2025 as LGBTQ+ Pride Month aimed at celebrating LGBTQ+ identities, culture, and achievements and honoring the history of resistance against oppression and violence; 
 
Resolved further, That the Los Angeles Unified District (District) reaffirms its commitment that all LGBTQ+ students and staff feel safe, heard, and respected. The District shall continue to advocate for equity, inclusion, and protection under the law and will support LGBTQ+ youth, families, and communities; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District shall ensure that staff are aware of all available resources for LGBTQ+ students, staff, and families, especially those experiencing mental health issues, including resources on the District’s Human Relations, Diversity, and Equity Division website to ensure they feel seen and affirmed in their identities.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is home to one of the largest immigrant populations in the country, including millions of undocumented, mixed-status, and refugee families who contribute to the cultural, economic, and civic fabric of our communities;
 
Whereas, The District has both a legal duty and a moral responsibility to safeguard our schools against any policy, mandate, or directive that violates civil or human rights, endangers the dignity and safety of our students, educators, or families or undermines our constitutional protections such as due process, equal protection under the law, freedom of speech, and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; 
 
Whereas, The District has reaffirmed its role as a sanctuary school district, committed to protecting the safety, rights, and educational access of all students and families, regardless of immigration status; 
 
Whereas, Across the United States, including in Los Angeles, immigrant communities are under renewed attack through increased criminalization, dehumanizing rhetoric, and the rise of militarized responses to peaceful demonstrations, labor organizing, and community gatherings;
 
Whereas, Authoritarian and fascist movements, past and present, have sought to distort truth, stoke fear and division, target marginalized communities, blur the separation of powers, and seize control of public institutions - especially schools - to silence opposition and concentrate power;
 
Whereas, The deployment of militarized federal agents, armed forces, and National Guard personnel, into Los Angeles neighborhoods, without invitation from state and local officials or consultation with community stakeholders, undermines public trust, disrupts community well-being, and threatens our democratic principles; 
 
Whereas, The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or any federal immigration enforcement agents on or near school campuses, or in connection with school operations, has a chilling effect on student attendance, family engagement, and school climate, particularly for undocumented and mixed-status communities;
 
Whereas, Immigrant residents are vital members of our communities - raising families, contributing to our schools and economy, building civic life, and advancing social justice - and deserve to live and work with dignity, safety, and respect; 
 
Whereas, Immigration raids, racial profiling, surveillance, and the detaining of individuals in  workplaces, courthouses, or our neighborhoods without warrants or regard for due process violates our fundamental rights and contradicts the values of equity and justice that LAUSD upholds; and
 
Whereas, We have now witnessed multiple disturbing incidents in which children have been forcibly separated from their parents in their communities, ripped from their families’ arms, left outside federal facilities and other locations without adult supervision, alone, scared, and traumatized exposing them to serious emotional harm and violating basic standards of human decency and child welfare, and
 
Whereas, Community members, advocates, and union members have shown courageous leadership in standing with immigrant families, and must be protected from criminalization or retaliation for exercising their fundamental rights and advocating for justice; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District reaffirms that all schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District are sanctuary spaces that protect the rights of every student, educator, staff, and family member - free from harassment, political intimidation, and cooperation with agencies engaged in unconstitutional or unethical actions, including immigration enforcement;
 
Resolved further, That the Board condemns the militarization of immigrant communities, including any uninvited deployment of federal agents, National Guard personnel, in our schools and communities without local request and transparent civilian oversight;
 
Resolved further, That the Board calls for the immediate rescission of the order to federalize the California National Guard, and the withdrawal of any National Guard, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or armed forces presence related to federal immigration actions in or near schools, communities, or the general vicinity of school campuses, school-related activities, and District partnerships or operations, related to federal immigration actions;
 
Resolved further, That the Board calls for the immediate access of all detainees to their families and to legal counsel;
 
Resolved further, That the Board affirms the lawful and constitutionally protected actions of all individuals who have peacefully assembled to oppose federal overreach, the erosion of constitutional principles, and recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. The Board condemns the criminalization of such actions and calls for the full exoneration of all individuals unjustly targeted for peacefully exercising their rights;
 
Resolved further, That the Board calls on all levels of government to uphold the constitutional rights of immigrants and citizens alike, including the right to due process, freedom from racial profiling, and the right to work, live, and advocate without fear of intimidation or criminalization; 
Resolved further, That the board vehemently denounces the detainment and deportation efforts of parents and their children while in the process of attending legally required immigration court proceedings, which have directly affected several LAUSD students and their families; 
 
Resolved further, That the District commits to continue the measures it has taken in the wake of the recent immigration raids throughout the Summer of Learning to ensure that our students, families and school communities are directly informed when ICE presence is confirmed, to protect student safety, reduce fear and confusion, and uphold the District’s sanctuary commitments; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board urges all relevant federal, state, and local agencies to immediately prohibit the separation of children from their families during immigration enforcement and deportation proceedings, and to ensure that no child is placed in isolated or inhumane detention conditions, including cages or facilities lacking proper oversight, support services, or family contact. The District calls for full transparency and independent monitoring of any facility where children may be held to safeguard their rights, dignity, and well-being;
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall ensure all relevant District divisions including the Office of Government Relations and Division of School of Operations in collaboration with the Office of Student, Family and Community Engagement, will work with community-based partners to inform immigrant students, families, and staff of their rights and to protect them from harm and to establish a streamlined, multilingual communication system in partnership with the City of Los Angeles, local cities, County agencies, and trusted community-based organizations to coordinate and respond to confirmed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sightings near schools or within District boundaries, in order to notify and prepare school sites, families, and students while prioritizing safety, legal rights, and trauma-informed support;
 
Resolved further, That the District is directed to establish clear and standardized protocols, including methods to verify immigration enforcement actions and the breadth of the radius of required school notifications within impacted neighborhoods and communities; 
 
Resolved further, That the Superintendent shall ensure all relevant District divisions will work with community-based partners to inform immigrant students, families, and staff of their rights and to uphold the constitutional rights of our students protect them from harm; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Board affirms its unwavering commitment to building a community rooted in dignity, equity, and justice for all, and urges public leaders to reject the criminalization of immigrant communities and instead stand with them in solidarity and action.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, Public education in California has faced decades of underfunding, and the state ranked 33rd in public education spending in fiscal year 2019-2020 before the influx of COVID-19 relief dollars; 
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is committed to providing all students with a high-quality public education and ensuring sufficient staffing to make our schools successful; 
 
Whereas, Our students need and deserve as many resources and supports as possible to be successful in their education and growth, a need only exacerbated by unprecedented federal attacks against the communities we serve; 
 
Whereas, The Board committed to evaluating proposals based on equity as defined in the “Accelerating Achievement through Equity in Action” resolution (Res-003-21/22); 
 
Whereas, LAUSD includes over 70,000 committed employees who work hard every day to ensure our students can learn, grow, and thrive in safe, clean and supportive schools; 
 
Whereas, The Board is considering a Fiscal Stabilization Plan, as required in Education Code (EC 4213), that seeks to address a structural deficit and ensure the school district’s budget remains sustainable for the next three years; and
 
Whereas, School district budget reductions during the Great Recession in 2008 had a disproportionate impact on high-needs students and schools, who lost funding and staff at greater levels than other schools, providing valuable lessons for future budgets; 
 
Whereas, The public deserves transparency and opportunities to weigh in on changes to the District’s budget prior to their implementation; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District, in its upcoming budget development and accompanying the finalization of any fiscal stabilization plan, shall ensure sufficient staffing at school sites and ensure that the Los Angeles Unified School District’s budget:
 
•                     Center students’ needs
o                     Any potential budgetary adjustment under consideration should be first and foremost evaluated for its impact on students, particularly the most vulnerable student groups. 
o                     The Board will protect essential student services as much as possible, including engaging and rigorous classroom instruction, school safety and supervision, cleanliness, nutrition, timely transportation, socioemotional and mental health support, strong school leadership, and before and after school care.
•                     Prioritize equity
o                     Wherever possible, any budget changes shall be made on the basis of equity, protecting schools and services dedicated to the highest needs populations, including Highest and High SENI schools and BSAP schools, Whenever possible, changes will not be made uniformly rather than by treating all schools the same. 
•                     Recognize the value of all employees
o                     Noting that staff, both classified and certificated, are critical to the success of students, the Board will seek to preserve jobs and ensure the maintenance of services and supports and work in meaningful collaboration with labor partners to identify solutions. 
 
Resolved further, That the Board will thoroughly consider and be the ultimate decision-maker of the trade-offs of budget investments. Recognizing the financial reality confronting the District, the Board will consider both short- and long-term reductions and new investments, including those made apart from the District’s budgeting process, with the above criteria in mind; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board commits to transparency in the finalization and implementation of the Fiscal Stabilization plan. In addition to the First and Second Interim updates in December and March, where updates and adjustments to the Fiscal Stabilization plan can be considered, the Board will discuss the plan and budget updates at two or more public Committee of the Whole meetings before December, and that the Board directs the relevant District staff to hold at least one regional town hall meetings in each Board District in collaboration with the Board Member offices in during the fall and utilize online surveys that are culturally and linguistically accessible to gather diverse stakeholder feedback from students, families, and school staff on the development of the District’s budget and the guiding principles listed herein; and, be if finally
 
Resolved, That prior to the fall committee of the whole meetings, this District publish an equity impact analysis, in accordance with Reso-003-21/22, to assess impacts to high need student groups (emergent bilinguals, students with disabilities, Black students, unhoused students, LGBTQIA+ students, and students in foster care) and school types (highest/high SENI, BSAP, Community Schools, Priority Schools, Linked Learning/CTE, etc.); and publish a department-level review of consulting contracts, administrative overhead, and central office expenditures and present options to the Board for reprioritization.",,,,,,,,

Body
Background: 
Annually, the Board of Education (Board) must hold a public hearing and adopt a budget consistent with the provisions of Education Code Section 42127.  Upon adoption, the budget is to be submitted to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) on or before July 1.
 
With the passage of Proposition 30, LA Unified shall receive part of its State entitlement through revenues from the Education Protection Account (EPA).  In order to receive these entitlements, the Board must, at an open meeting, make spending determinations regarding EPA funds.  
Proposition 30 revenues, extended by Proposition 55 through 2030, are allocated to school districts through the EPA.  These are not additional funds outside of the Local Control Funding Formula, but rather another source of the general purpose funds (similar to local property taxes) that offsets what would otherwise be state funding.
 
EPA funds may not be used for any salaries or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs. LA Unified is also required to annually publish on its website an accounting of how much EPA funds were received and how the funds were spent.
 
Sections 42127 and 52062 of the Education Code require two separate Governing Board public meetings for the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and the Budget, one for the public hearing of the LCAP and Budget and a subsequent meeting for the adoption. The LCAP public hearing and adoption must occur at the same meetings as the budget public hearing and adoption. 
 
As required by Senate Bill (SB) 858/751, Attachment D sets forth the minimum reserve level required in each year, amounts of assigned and unassigned ending balance that exceed the minimum, and reasons for the reserve being greater than the minimum. 
 
The interfund transfer and temporary borrowing authorization is an annual request to allow staff to process accounting transactions related to interfund transfers and temporary borrowings. Interfund transfers are made between funds for various purposes, including transfers for debt service requirements. Temporary borrowings are made in situations where LA Unified advances cash from a fund with sufficient cash balance to pay obligations of a fund with insufficient cash balance. Repayments of the cash advances are made within statutory timelines.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The expected outcome is an adopted budget for FY 2025-26 that shall enable LA Unified to comply with Education Code Section 42127. A further expected outcome is adoption of Resolution Regarding EPA expenditures for 2025-26.  Additionally, approval of the Resolution to Commit Funding to Protect Against Federal Uncertainties shall ensure funds are used for a specific purpose(s) unless the Board takes subsequent formal action to uncommit the originally imposed constraint. Furthermore, approval of interfund transfers and temporary borrowings authorization shall ensure that interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings are authorized beginning in July 2025.  This will enable LA Unified staff to make required and timely interfund transfers or temporary borrowings in the 2025-26 fiscal year.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Should the Board adopt the item, approve authorizing the proposed actions, LA Unified will meet the annual budget adoption requirements of Education Code Section 42127. 
 
If the Board does not authorize the proposed actions, LA Unified will not meet the requirements of Education Code Section 42127.  Non-approval of the EPA resolution as set forth in Proposition 30, extended by Proposition 55, may place the EPA entitlement at risk.  Without approval to commit funding to protect against federal uncertainties, LA Unified will not be able to implement any proposed changes to commitments. Without prior approval to process interfund transfers and temporary borrowings, LA Unified staff will not have the authority to make required and timely interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings in Fiscal Year 2025-26.
 
Policy Implications: 
Adoption of the Proposed 2025-26 Budget, approval of the Resolution Regarding Expenditures from the EPA, approval of the Resolution to Commit Funding to Protect Against Federal Uncertainties, and delegation of authority to make interfund transfers and/or temporary borrowings shall comply with the Education Code and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requirements. 
 
Budget Impact: 
Adoption of the Proposed 2025-26 Budget.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code and GASB requirements ensures that LA Unified shall continue to operate and serve its student population responsibly.

The proposed budget is LA Unified’s plan for the upcoming school year 2025-26 related to anticipated revenues and expenditures for all LA Unified funds with the General Fund being the largest fund. This budget includes Federal, State, and Local resources that are allocated directly to schools based on student needs that are measured by various indicators.  Resources are allocated to address student needs. Programs allocated using various needs indicators include, but are not limited to, the Student Equity Needs Index (SENI), Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP), Arts Program, and Title I.



Resource Prioritization

    4

 Within the General Fund is the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) which is the largest unrestricted source of funding for schools. LCFF provides baseline funding for all students and additional resources to schools with high concentrations of low-income students, English Learners, and students in foster care.  



Results

    4

The budget includes investments in schools to improve student achievement and equity across all student groups. The goal is to build fairness and inclusion and ensure every student has the opportunity to achieve their academic goals.

end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)’s 2025 Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a state mandated three-year plan that is updated each year and describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures of Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. Every year, the District partners with our communities to develop and update the LCAP.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The District LCAP must be adopted at the same meeting at which the Board of Education adopts the budget for 2025-2026. The 2025-26 LCAP is the second year of the three year cycle for 2024-27, and provides available baseline and Year 1 outcomes for LCAP metrics and includes annual updates on the implementation of LCAP actions in 2024-25. The LCAP also includes separate Action Tables in addition to the Budget Overview for Parents. These materials must all be combined and posted on the District’s website.
 
Through the LCAP engagement cycle, the LCAP team has had robust engagement with educational partners across the District through student focus groups, parent committee meetings, community partner meetings, District team meetings, labor partner meetings, and Region engagement meetings. Furthermore, the LCAP team supported school principals with an LCAP Coffee with the Principal presentation to assist schools with sharing information about the District LCAP and their school’s progress towards goals in the LCAP, which are aligned with the District's Strategic Plan. The ThoughtExchanges for the LCAP has over 17,000 participants. We are appreciative of the feedback and comments provided by the Parent Advisory Committee, District English Learner Advisory Committee, Superintendent’s Student Advisory Council, and a large number of our educational partners. All voices are important and provide direction to the development of the LCAP. As always, we will continue to work to gather input and feedback from our Los Angeles Unified communities about our programs and services to support students.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this LCAP will allow the District to meet state-mandated requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote, will result in the District meeting the state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
A “No” vote, will result in the District not meeting the state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
Policy Implications: 
The District LCAP is aligned with the District Strategic Plan and reflects annual updates from the 2024-25 school year, and includes planned goals, actions, and expenditures for 2025-26. The 2025-26 LCAP is the second year of the three year cycle for 2024-27. The District may make changes to the LCAP each year to reflect community feedback as well as changes in District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
Approval of the District’s LCAP is necessary to approve the budget. Existing staff and resources will support posting the LCAP to the District website.
 
Student Impact:
This proposed action shares the District’s engagement, planning and budgeting to meet student needs in 2025-26. Through engagement, meetings were held to receive input on the Plan as part of this engagement, and the LCAP ThoughtExchanges collected 161,191 ratings on 10,335 comments from 17,833 participants. In the LCAP ThoughtExchanges, 3,450 participants identified as students.

The LCAP describes how the District will implement programs and policies to support all students in the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) state priority areas, as well as how the District will leverage supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low-income students. Additionally, our communities have advocated for additional transparency and visibility into English Learner Supports and the Black Student Achievement Plan, and the LCAP continues to report on the progress of these programs, analysis, and funding information as official Goals in the document.



Resource Prioritization

       4

As stated above, the LCAP describes how the District will allocate resources in 2025-26 to support the LCFF target student populations (84% of LAUSDs enrollment), as well as additional investments for non- LCFF target student populations (including Black students and Special Education students).



Results

       4

The LCAP allocates and annually monitors the use of LCFF dollars to improve student equity across all student groups by eliminating opportunity gaps and preparing students to be ready for the world as evidenced in District goals and actions.

Issues and Analysis: 
The LCAP describes how the District will implement programs and policies to support all students in the LCFF state priority areas, as well as how the District will leverage supplemental and concentration funds to increase or improve services for English learners, students in foster care, and low-income students. The LCAP is aligned to reflect 2022-26 Strategic Plan Pillars, strategies, and priorities.
 
The LCAP includes all state LCFF funds and Equity Multiplier Funds for Equity Multiplier eligible schools, but does not reflect any other local, state, and federal sources of funding.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the Affiliated Charter Schools’ 2025 Local Control and Accountability Plans. The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a state mandated three-year plan that is updated each year and describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures of Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. Every year, the 51 Affiliated Charter Schools develop and update their LCAPs.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Based on the state Education Code, each Affiliated Charter School is its own local education agency, so each must complete a separate written LCAP. These LCAPS must be adopted at the same meeting at which the Board of Education adopts the budget for 2025-2026. The 2025-26 LCAP is the first year of the three year cycle for 2024-27 and provides available Baseline and Year 1 Outcomes for LCAP metrics and includes annual updates on the implementation of LCAP actions in 2024-25. The LCAPs also include separate Action Tables in addition to the Budget Overviews for Parents. These materials must all be combined and posted on each Affiliated Charter School's website.
 
As part of the District’s support for our 51 Affiliated Charter Schools, the District LCAP team supports the development of these LCAPs by providing budgetary and metric data along with working with Affiliated Charter Schools to share specific school LCAP information to communicate the progress at their school sites. Affiliated Charter Schools are supported by the LCAP team through ongoing training, guidance and direct support that spans year-round, which includes hybrid office hours, work group sessions and one-on-one consultations to ensure compliance and alignment to the District LCAP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these LCAPs will allow District Affiliated Charter Schools to meet the state-mandated requirement.
 
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
A “No” vote, will result in the Affiliated Charter Schools not meeting their state-mandated requirement to approve the LCAP.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policies.
 
Budget Impact: 
Approval of these Affiliated Charter Schools’ LCAPs is necessary to approve their budgets. Existing staff and resources will support posting the LCAP to the District and Affiliated Charter Schools’ websites.
 
Student Impact:

The 2025 Affiliated Charter Schools LCAPs also address a requirement first implemented through state mandate in 2023 to calculate and report carryover of unspent supplemental and concentration funds to support future increased or improved services. This carryover calculation only reflects funds that are under school discretion and which carry over within these schools’ budgets.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote would effectuate the processing of personnel actions for classified, certificated and senior management employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer and new appointments.
 
A “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints, impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the acceptance of the Certified Wellness Coach Employer Support Grant in the amount of $8,093,946 awarded to the District for a period beginning August 31, 2024 through June 2026; and authorize the Chief Procurement Officer or his designee to execute professional services contracts with partners, as appropriate, for administration of the grant, and Student Mental Health and Wellness Services staff to perform related functions such as the administration of necessary grant-related activities, submittal of follow-up reports and/or documentation to the grantor to secure or maintain funding.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) was awarded the Certified Wellness Coach (CWC) Employer Support Grant by the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI)-marking the first time the District has received this funding. The grant has allowed LAUSD to sustain approximately 86 Student and Family Resource Navigator (SFRN) positions previously funded through one-time funding sources.
 
SFRNs serve over 15,000 students and families annually, providing essential wellness services such as mental and physical health support, basic needs (food, clothing, and shelter), and health insurance enrollment. These services are accessed through multiple pathways: referrals from school staff, our online request portal, and the Student and Family Wellness Resource Line.
 
Expected Outcomes:
In alignment with the District’s Strategic Plan, Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness, this grant will enable LAUSD to continue to promote whole-child well-being through integrated health, nutrition, and wellness services, while also reducing barriers to our students and families accessing needed resources. Key performance benchmarks include enrolling families in health insurance and delivering parent and caregiver workshops across the District.
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote will enable the District to sustain the current workforce of Student and Family Resources Navigators during the duration of the grant at least through June 2026 and ensure thousands of our most vulnerable students and families have access to the care they need most.
 
A “No” vote, the District may not be able to maintain the current Student and Family Resources Navigator work force or would need to rely on other District resources to support this work. Consequently, the District will not be able to offer the same level of support and assistance to our most needy students and families.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy
 
Budget Impact: 
The grant funds must be administered in accordance with all provisions of state and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to the administration, use and accounting for public school funds, including, but not limited to, the Education Code of the State of California.
 
The grant will provide $8,093,946.00 in additional funding to the District for the duration of the grant through June 2026 (Budget is included in Attachment A).
 
Student Impact:
Ratification of this grant will enable the District to retain Student and Family Resources Navigators to serve our students needing access to wellness services, which will positively impact the achievement of all students.

Action Proposed: 
Ratify the acceptance of two grant awards from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, totaling $1,485,000 and authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or designee to execute professional services contracts with external partners, colleges and universities as necessary to support the implementation of the California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program.  The RLAA grant will be administered through LAUSD’s in-house, accredited program.  No external partners, colleges, or universities are required or listed.​ 
end
 
Body
Background: 
The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing was established to help address the statewide teacher shortage by supporting Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in recruiting classified employees into teaching careers.  The program provides financial assistance for participants’ undergraduate education, teacher preparation, and credentialing as California certified teachers.  
​ 
​The District has been a recurring recipient of this grant, with awards received in 2017, 2022, 2023, and now in 2025. This current grant award of $960,000 will support the District’s Building Our Own Staff as Teachers program (BOOST) for the 2025-26 school year.  Funding is expected to support up to 100 classified employees annually over a two-year period.  Each participant may receive up to $4,800 per year to cover tuition reimbursement and other education or credentialing-related expenses.  Of this amount, $4,500 is provided directly to the employee as a living stipend with $300 being allocated for administrative costs, professional development, and test preparation. Classified employees must apply through a competitive selection process. Once admitted, participants must remain in good standing as District employees, with annual validation of performance evaluations, attendance records, and principal/administrator endorsement for continued enrollment.   
​ 
​In its grant application, LAUSD included all of the Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) with which it holds articulation agreements. These partnerships allow BOOST members to follow a streamlined, multi-year plan toward credentialing while minimizing redundant coursework.  Participating institutions include: California State University Dominguez Hills, California State University Los Angeles, California State University Long Beach, California State University Northridge, and the District’s Intern, Credentialing, and Added Authorization Program (iCAAP). These institutions do not receive direct funding from the grant. All funds are administered by the District and disbursed to employee and program support services.

​ 
​The Reading and Literacy Supplementary Authorization Incentive Grant Program is a California state initiative aimed at expanding the pool of credentialed teachers with specialized expertise in reading and literacy instruction. This program provides funding to support credentialed teachers in obtaining a Reading and Literacy Added Authorization (RLAA) or a Reading and Literacy Leadership Specialist (RLLS) credential.  Both credentials are issued through the Commission on Teaching Credentialing (CTC) and are designed to address the growing need for literacy-focused educators amid statewide efforts to improve student reading proficiency.  RLAA equips educators with advanced skills in literacy instruction and intervention, assessment and data-driven decision making, and designing and implementing comprehensive reading programs.  RLLS prepares educators to leadership roles in literacy, including coaching, curriculum development, and school-wide literacy initiatives.  Through rigorous coursework aligned with CTC standards and a structured clinical practicum, candidates learn to use data to inform instruction, design targeted interventions, and implement comprehensive reading programs.  
​ 
​This $525,000 RLAA incentive grant award will provide funding over a three-year period to help address the urgent need for educators with specialized knowledge and skills to support students with reading difficulties, including dyslexia. Currently, the RLAA program enrolls 45-50 candidates annually.  With the new funding, enrollment capacity will increase up to 70 participants per year, supporting a total of 210 over the three-year period.  
​ 
​LAUSD’s accredited RLAA <https://www.lausd.org/Page/7722> program equips credentialed teachers with the expertise to assess, instruct, and intervene using evidence-based literacy practices. Through rigorous coursework aligned with CTC standards and a structured clinical practicum, candidates learn to analyze student data to inform instruction, design targeted interventions, and implement comprehensive reading programs. This training ensures teachers are well-prepared to advance equitable literacy outcomes for diverse learners across Los Angeles Unified. 
​ 
​The RLAA Grant will provide funding for eligible teachers to pursue the added authorization, thereby strengthening the District’s internal capacity to deliver high-quality, research-based literacy instruction.

Expected Outcomes:
In alignment with Pillar1: Academic Excellence, of the District’s Strategic Plan, the Human Resources Division will expand the capacity of the RLAA program to better serve educators working in LAUSD’s school communities.  This grant represents a strategic investment in building teacher capacity through high-quality professional development. 
​ 
​These grants will enhance LAUSD’s teacher and administrator training to remain competitive in recruitment and retention, while strengthening dedicated pipelines of future educators committed to preparing students to be college-prepared, career-ready, and Ready for the World. 
​ 
​This initiative reinforces LAUSD’s leadership in educator preparation and positions the District as a competitive force in the statewide effort to improve literacy outcomes and educational equity. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Ratification of these grants will enable the District to partner with local universities to offer and support a range of credentialing and supplementary authorization programs, including opportunities for Classified employees seeking to become teachers.  These partnerships are essential to expanding access to high-quality educator preparation and strengthening internal pipelines.  
​ 
​If the grants were not approved, the District would be unable to move forward with these university partnerships and we could lose the vital pipeline of well-prepared, highly qualified teachers and administrators.  Without this support, the District would not be able to provide the same level of financial assistance and professional development to classified employees pursuing teaching careers.  This would significantly hinder efforts to address teacher shortages in critical areas such as STEM, special education, bilingual education, physical education, and the Arts. This would result in fewer classified employees transitioning into certificated roles that directly support students in the classroom.    
​ 
 
 
​Ratification of this grant will allow the District to expand the RLAA program, making it accessible to educators serving at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels. With over 25,000 K-12 teachers in LAUSD, this grant provides a critical opportunity to increase the number of reading and literacy specialists, ensuring that our students are college-prepared, career-ready, and Ready for the World. 
​ 
​If the grants are not ratified, the District may face a continued shortage of educators with the Reading and Literacy Added Authorization due to the current program’s limited capacity. Expanding access to this added authorization is essential to closing the achievement gap in reading and literacy.  Ideally, all teachers would hold this authorization to ensure every student receives a high-quality, evidence-based literacy instruction.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The grant funds must be administered in accordance with all applicable state and local laws, regulations, and policies governing the use and accountability of public school funds, including, but not limited to, the Education Code of the State of California.
 
​The grants will prove up to $1,485,000 in additional funding to the District over the duration of the grant period. 
 
​The California Classified School Employees Teacher Credentialing Program does not require matching funds resulting in no budget impact.
  
​As outlined by the California Department of Education, the District is responsible for meeting two matching fund requirements associated with the RLAA grant. The first is an in-kind contribution equivalent to the $525,00 grant amount, which will be fulfilled though existing staff positions within the Division of Human Resources that support RLAA grant activities. The second requirement is a direct contribution of $126,000 for books, supplies, and instructional materials for participating teachers.  These costs will be covered through a combination of existing resources and the Educator Effectiveness Block Grant. 
 
Student Impact:
Ratification of these grants will enable the District to expand its capacity to recruit, prepare, and support highly qualified teachers and administrators. This is especially critical in high-need areas, including special education, where credentialed teachers are essential to serving students with disabilities. 
​ 
​By investing in educator training and expanding the number of teachers with specialized credentials in reading and literacy, the District will strengthen instructional quality and improve academic outcomes for all students, thereby supporting education equity and closing achievement gaps. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program supports the District’s efforts to maintain a strong classified to certificated employee pipeline by offering financial assistance and mentorship to aspiring educators currently serving in classified roles.  Through this grant selected participants will receive a living stipend of $4,500 a year, which can be used to offset credentialing and education related expenses including tuition, textbooks, technology, testing fees, and transportation.  
​ 
​LAUSD received funding through Round 7 of the grant, with a liquidation period ending June 30, 2028.  As part of the grant compliance requirements, the District must submit annual reports each July detailing expenditures and participant data.

Brief Description:
(Authorization to Execute a Joint Powers Agreement with the City of Los Angeles for the Community School Parks Program) Recommends to authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) and related documents with the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (City) for the continued operation and expansion of the Community School Parks (CSPs) Program at various campuses, including the addition of new sites as CSPs.
end

Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute a JPA and any other reasonable instruments with the City for the operation of the CSPs Program at various campuses, and authorization to add new CSPs.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The City and Los Angeles Unified have a long history of collaborating with one another on common interests via Joint Use and Joint Powers Agreements, permits, licenses and other use agreements. On February 26, 2008, the Board of Education (Board) and the City of Los Angeles City Council adopted companion Resolutions entitled: “Create School-Community Parks in Partnership with Community Groups and the City of Los Angeles” in support of making Los Angeles Unified schools available to the community. In 2015, the City of Los Angeles unveiled its Sustainable City pLAn / Green New Deal which established the City of Los Angeles’s goal of increasing the percentage of residents living within one-half mile of a park to 65% by 2025, and to 75% by 2035. On February 01, 2017, the Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners (City’s Board) approved a CSP Pilot Program to increase park access in park deficient areas in the City of Los Angeles. The City has challenges in meeting this goal due to a lengthy acquisition and development process for new park property and limited funding. The City identified Los Angeles Unified elementary and middle schools in park deficient areas and engaged the Los Angeles Unified in creating a sustainable plan for creating CSPs, schools where the play yards and outdoor facilities of schools are open to the public, students and the community during weekends, school holidays and school vacation periods for recreational use. The City subsequently identified and earmarked funding for this effort to cover Los Angeles Unified’s direct costs in assisting with the operation of the CSPs.
 
On April 18, 2017, the Board approved, and on December 11, 2017, the City and Los Angeles Unified entered into an Agreement for the operation of CSPs (Original Agreement) at four Los Angeles Unified elementary schools in park deficient areas. Under the terms of the Original Agreement, the City hired staff responsible for providing the necessary supervision at the CSPs. The Original Agreement was for a trial period of one year, during which time the City and Los Angeles Unified committed to working together to add school sites and negotiate long term CSP agreements. The one-year trial period ended, however, the City and Los Angeles Unified continued operating the CSPs while working on adding programming at the existing CSP sites and working on adding more schools.  
 
On February 19, 2019, the Board approved the extension of the Original Agreement for a period of one year, to commence at the expiration of the Original Agreement on December 11, 2018, with a one-year extension option (Extension Agreement), which the City exercised upon Board approval. The Extension Agreement was set to terminate on December 10, 2020, however, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and related health and safety guidance, Los Angeles Unified ceased all use of school sites by third parties on March 12, 2020, and the CSP program was suspended.  
 
By 2022, Los Angeles Unified began reopening school campuses for third-party use. At that time, the City expressed interest in reactivating the CSP program, this time focusing on middle schools due to their grass fields, which allow for expanded outdoor programming. To quickly relaunch the program, the City initiated use of three middle school sites-Barack Obama Global Preparation Academy, Bethune Middle School, and Northridge Middle School-through Civic Center permits issued by Los Angeles Unified. By 2024, the program had expanded to include 10 CSP sites (Current CSP). (See Exhibit A for the list of Current CSP schools.)
 
The City has identified and earmarked funding to support the ongoing use of, and the implementation of programming at, the Current CSPs. If at any point during the term of the JPA, as it may be extended, City funding becomes unavailable for the continued operation of one or more of the CSPs, Los Angeles Unified will not have an obligation to continue operating the schools as CSPs. If the City identifies additional funding, the parties may mutually agree to add schools to the CSPs program. Any additional schools will be operated on the same terms and conditions outlined in the JPA.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the action will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to execute the JPA and any other reasonable instruments for the operation of CSPs.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote by the Board will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to negotiate and execute the JPA and any other reasonable instruments for the City’s operation of the Current CSPs and the addition of future CSPs with the parties’ mutual agreement and with prior authorization by the City’s Board. The CSPs will continue to provide much needed access to outdoor recreational space for the students of the CSP schools and their surrounding communities during weekends, school holidays and school vacation periods. Los Angeles Unified and the City will continue to work cooperatively in ensuring the safe operation of CSPs.
 
A “No” vote will prohibit the City from utilizing the earmarked funding, the Current CSPs will cease operation and the students and community that have accessed the Current CSPs will once again find themselves lacking in the use of outdoor space for recreational purposes.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action helps facilitate the Board’s Resolution, adopted on February 26, 2008, to “Create School-Community Parks in Partnership with Community Groups and the City of Los Angeles.” Additionally, CSPs is an area for exploration included in the 100 Day Plan as part of the Advocacy Strategy for pursuing education compacts with governmental entities and the initiative supports LAUSD’s Strategic Plan Pillar 2 on Joy and Wellness and Pillar 3 on Engagement and Collaboration.
 
Budget Impact: 
The City will provide funding for the operation of the CSPs. As such, no funding from Los Angeles Unified’s General Fund or Bond program funds will be required.
 
Student Impact: 
Students from the schools that have CSPs and those from the surrounding schools who do not have a City park within half a mile of their home now have a safe place to enjoy outdoor recreation and programs.
 
Equity Impact:
CSPs are located in areas that lack sufficient park space. If the City identifies additional funding and schools in areas that can greatly benefit from opening new CSPs, Los Angeles Unified will work with the City to ensure the new CSPs are open for the benefit of the students and the community. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Staff has reached an agreement with the City on the material terms of the operation and maintenance of the CSPs as follows:
 
1.                     The JPA will be for a term of 10 years, with two options, each option being for five years. If each option is exercised, the JPA will have a duration of a total of 20 years.
 
2.                     Operation of the Current CSPs and/or any new CSP is contingent on the City providing funding. If the City does not have sufficient funding, the City will cease operating the CSPs, and additional schools will not be identified for the program. Furthermore, if City funding becomes unavailable at any point in time, Los Angeles Unified will not have an obligation to continue operating the schools as CSPs.  
 
3.                     Use of the CSPs will be open to the public free of charge. It is expected that all types of outdoor activities will conform generally to those which are permitted under a Civic Center Permit; any additional proposed activities are subject to review and approval by Los Angeles Unified.   
 
4.                     The play yards and outdoor facilities at CSP schools will be open to the public, including students and the community, during weekends, school holidays and school vacation periods for recreational use.
 
5.                     The City is responsible for all costs associated with the operation, maintenance, staffing and security of CSPs. This includes, but is not limited to, the opening and closing of the facilities, including the restrooms, which will be opened and closed on an as-needed basis.  
 
6.                     Los Angeles Unified will provide custodial support, at City’s expense, to ensure the schools are ready for instruction after the operation of the CSPs.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Seven Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of seven critical school facility projects to replace and upgrade essential building and site systems, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $36,193,839, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve seven projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $36,193,839.  
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Cienega Elementary School, Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, Manhattan Elementary School, and Haynes Charter for Enriched Studies; field upgrade projects at Fairfax High School and Huntington Park High School; and a stormwater retention tank replacement project at Walnut Park Middle School.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
The School Construction Bond Citizens' Oversight Committee (BOC) reviewed this item at its August 14, 2025 meeting. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the District presented the bond-funded proposal to the BOC for their recommendation before Board consideration. The BOC decided to consider some of the projects separately, adopting a resolution recommending the Board approve five projects, as detailed in Exhibit B (four roofing and one stormwater retention tank replacement), and failing to make a recommendation on the two synthetic turf and track replacement projects, as detailed in Exhibit C.
 
Having fulfilled the requirements of the MOU requirements, all projects will be presented to the Board for consideration and action. The BOC presentation is included as Exhibit D.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve seven projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the seven proposed Projects is $36,193,839 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 6,050 current and future students attending these seven schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
Equity Impact: 
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Los Angeles Unified continues to follow Policy Bulletin BUL-6847.0 - Policy for Selection, Usage, and Maintenance of Synthetic Turf Fields, as referenced in Exhibit E. The policy establishes, among other items, that existing synthetic turf fields will be replaced with new synthetic turf unless they are not in high-usage areas. These projects align with the policy as the Fairfax High School and Huntington Park High School athletic fields meet the criteria of high-usage areas that serve school competitive sports and community activities.
 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Two Early Education Center Outdoor Classroom Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of two projects to provide outdoor classrooms at early education centers, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $2,635,299, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legal permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve two Early Education Center (EEC) Outdoor Classroom Projects (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $2,635,299.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Projects will provide outdoor classrooms by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. The intent of the proposed Projects is to create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classrooms may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging
•                     Building materials
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on August 14, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board of Education will define and approve the proposed Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Projects. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and access to nature-based green space will remain limited.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the proposed Projects is $2,635,299. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each budget for the proposed Projects was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about their proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual budgets for the proposed Projects will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known and/or unforeseen conditions arise, and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each of the proposed Projects.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning to benefit approximately 184 current and future students.
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor classrooms will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
Equity Impact:
The proposed Projects were identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with Regions and school site administrators. Sites were selected based upon each center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Projects’ proposals in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Projects’ scopes will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Projects’ scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 27 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 27 Board District Priority and Region Priority projects, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to includes these projects, with a combined budget of $1,578,259, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 27 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $1,578,259.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on August 14, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the schools and their students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 27 proposed projects is $1,578,259. Twenty-two projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Five projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 14,300 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions) Recommends the ratification of the Procurement Services Division contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; award of professional services contract; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts; emergency contracts/purchase orders and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including playground matting task order contracts (PCC 20118.5-.9).

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including:
end
 
Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013 Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 08, 2018.
 
 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact:
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendment; After the Fact Transactions; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts: Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts as listed in Attachment “B.”

Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.

Brief Description:
(Authorization to execute an agreement with Palmer Third Street Properties LP for use of a portion of the Visconti Parking Garage located at 1221 West 3rd Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017) Recommends authorization to execute a new seven-year, $8,467,200 agreement with Palmer Third Street Properties LP for continued use of 630 parking spaces at the Visconti Parking Garage, located at 1221 West 3rd Street, Los Angeles, to support District staff and visitor parking at the Los Angeles Unified Headquarters Building (Beaudry Building); and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to execute the new Parking Use Agreement with the landlord.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute a Parking Use Agreement (“Agreement”) with Palmer Third Street Properties LP (“Landlord”), for exclusive use of 630 parking spaces within the Visconti Parking Garage, for a term beginning on October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2032, in the amount of $8,467,200.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The demand for daily parking generated by District employees, visitors, contract professionals (who pay for parking), or other users associated with District’s administrative headquarter operations at 333 South Beaudry Avenue in Los Angeles (“Beaudry Building”), cannot be accommodated in the Beaudry Building garage. As a result, additional parking has been provided at nearby facilities including Beaudry II parking garage (233 S. Beaudry Avenue), Visconti Parking Garage, and the Huntley surface lot (1141 Huntley Drive).
 
The Beaudry Building accommodates about 3,100 occupants with assigned parking across the Beaudry Building garage, Beaudry II parking garage, Visconti Garage, and Huntley Lot. Approximately 2,600 spaces are available daily and may be over-assigned based on average daily demand. Visitor parking is limited to the Visconti Parking Garage and Huntley surface lot, subject to availability.
 
An existing agreement with Landlord commenced on October 1, 2022 and provides the District with exclusive use of 630 parking spaces across three contiguous levels of the Visconti Parking Garage from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM Monday through Friday. Additionally, the District has the right to exclusive use of these parking spaces after hours for late departures, overnight parking, and weekend parking, when necessary. 
 
Pursuant to this three-year agreement, the District pays $160 per space/ $100,800 per month, totaling $1,209,600 per year.

The Visconti Parking Garage is located within the boundaries of Region East and Board District 2 (Dr. Rocio Rivas).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Agreement with Landlord for the use of parking spaces in the Visconti Parking Garage, to accommodate employees, contract professionals, and visitors to the Beaudry Building.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of the proposed action will ensure continued parking at the Visconti Parking Garage for employees, contract professionals, and visitors.
 
If the Board does not approve the proposed action, the District would no longer be able to provide 630 parking spaces for employees, contract professionals, and visitors in the Visconti Parking Garage. The reduction in available parking spaces to support the Beaudry Building would impact operations by limiting access to work daily at the Beaudry Building and for visitors to attend meetings, conferences, professional development, and other necessary activities to strengthen and support schools.  
 
Policy Implications: 
There is no change to District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total projected cost of the Agreement, over the seven-year term, is $8,467,200 and will be funded by General Fund Admin Office Parking Lease Program 16653.
 
Student Impact: 
None
 
Equity Impact: 
The proposed action supports the District’s Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness and Pillar 5 Investing in Staff by providing parking to employees, contract professionals, and visitors accessing the Beaudry Building.
Issues and Analysis:                      
A recent survey of the area surrounding the Beaudry Building has revealed that alternative parking options are extremely limited, insufficient, and more expensive than the Visconti Parking Garage. There are no available locations that can accommodate the required 630 parking spaces in one facility. At least two of the alternative parking options consist of uncovered spaces that are priced higher than the Visconti Parking Garage, which offers a fully covered and secure parking environment. Other alternatives are significantly more expensive and located further away, which would require potential costs associated with shuttles and safety officers in addition to the parking fees, thereby exceeding the cost of the Agreement.

Brief Description:
(Authorization to execute a 39-month lease extension with B9 VN Roscoe Owner, LLC (“Landlord”) for Use of the Van Nuys Bus Yard Located at 16200 Roscoe Boulevard, Van Nuys, CA, 91406 (“Van Nuys Bus Yard”)) Recommends that the Board of Education (“Board”) authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute a 39-month lease extension for $9,307,531.17, and any other reasonable instruments for the continued use of the Van Nuys Bus Yard.
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute a lease extension and any other reasonable instruments for the continued use of the Van Nuys Bus Yard for a term beginning September 18, 2025, through November 30, 2028, in the amount of $9,307, 531.17.
 
Body
Background: 
On September 29, 1999, the Los Angeles Unified School District (“District”) entered into a 20-year lease agreement for the Van Nuys Bus Yard (“Lease”). The facility serves as a dedicated school bus parking lot and an onsite maintenance garage that enables the District to perform routine vehicle maintenance and repairs. The Lease commenced on September 18, 2000, and was originally set to expire on September 17, 2020. In September 2020, the District exercised its option to extend the Lease for an additional five years, with the current term expiring on September 17, 2025.
 
The District currently stores, maintains, and dispatches approximately 200 school buses at the Van Nuys Bus Yard. The long-term plan is to relocate the buses and maintenance operations currently located at the Van Nuys Bus Yard to 11660 Tuxford Street, Sun Valley (“Tuxford Site”), an approximately seven-acre property the District is currently leasing as a temporary bus yard during construction of the Sun Valley Bus Yard Electrification Project (“Project”), currently anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2027. As outlined in a September 27, 2024 informative (attached), the District executed the lease for the Tuxford Site in May 2024 for a period of seven years, with two options to renew for five years each. While the seven-year term exceeded the need for the Project, it aligned with the District's long-term plan of relocating the Van Nuys Bus Yard operations to the Tuxford Site upon completion of the Project, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing concurrent leases.
 
This proposed lease extension will allow the District continued use of the Van Nuys Bus Yard through November 2028, ensuring that there is no interruption to the District’s transportation services. The lease terms negotiated between the District and the Landlord includes a 39-month lease term, which was the minimum duration required by the Landlord, as well as two months of abated rent that was included as part of the negotiations.  The proposed lease term extends beyond the Project’s anticipated completion to allow for potential delays, and for the transition of operations to the Tuxford Site.  Any additional costs due to the longer lease term are less than the alternative of identifying and entering into short-term leases at other sites, which would be more expensive due to the cost of site improvements and additional moving costs.

The Van Nuys Bus Yard is located within the boundaries of Region North and Board District 3 (Scott Schmerelson).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the lease extension agreement with Landlord for the continued use of the Van Nuys Bus Yard.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board approves this action, staff will execute a lease extension to ensure uninterrupted transportation operations until the transition of the Van Nuys Bus Yard operations to the Tuxford Site. This will allow the District to avoid additional costs to secure temporary facilities and will support key strategic objectives.
 
If the Board does not approve this action, the lease will expire on September 17, 2025, requiring the District to secure alternative accommodations for approximately 200 school buses. This could result in operational disruptions and increased costs.
 
Policy Implications: 
Advances Pillar 4 (Operational Effectiveness) of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by safeguarding core services and enabling the District’s- transition to a greener fleet.
 
Budget Impact: 
Total not to exceed cost is $9,307,531.17 over 39 months to be funded from General Fund TIIPG Rental Transportation Program 15134.
 
Student Impact: 
Ensures timely, reliable transportation for daily attendance and extracurricular programs, thereby supporting student achievement and engagement District-wide.
 
Equity Impact: 
Maintains equitable access to safe transportation for students across all Board Districts, including historically underserved communities.
 
Issues and Analysis:                      
Extending the Van Nuys Bus Yard Lease is critical to maintaining bus fleet operations during a major capital transition. The facility’s existing capacity and location cannot be replicated quickly elsewhere. Approval mitigates operational risk, supports the phased electrification strategy, and protects student access to education.

Brief Description:
(Consideration of a Business Improvement District Petition for Chinatown BID) Recommends the Board of Education authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to submit petitions, ballots, or related documents on behalf of Los Angeles Unified staff in support of renewing the Chinatown Business Improvement District (BID) Petition, contingent on securing a 50% or more discount in the proposed annual assessment.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to submit a petition(s) and subsequently a ballot(s), and/or execute any other reasonable instruments on behalf of Los Angeles Unified in support of the renewal of the Chinatown BID Petition within the City of Los Angeles (City), conditioned upon the BID providing a discount of 50% or more of the proposed annual assessment.
end
 
Body
Background: 
A BID is formed when interested parties unite to propose a BID to serve a specific purpose for an identified geographic area. The BID proposal identifies the general services, activities, and programs to be paid for through special assessments charged to all property owners within the BID in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and costs incurred to provide the agreed-upon services, activities, and programs. BIDs provide enhanced services which may include private security patrols (often referred to as ambassadors), sidewalk cleaning and pressure washing, graffiti removal, landscaping, maintenance improvements, special events, BID branding and marketing. 
 
Each BID develops an annual budget based upon the services provided. The amount of each property owner’s assessment of the budget is typically based on a formula that includes the square feet of the parcel and its buildings, and linear foot of frontage of the parcel. The assessments are collected by the City, placed in a trust fund for each BID and funds are periodically released to support operations withing the particular BID. A BID can range from three to 10 years in duration. In order to form a BID or renew a BID, a majority of the property owners (50.1%) in the BID area must affirmatively vote in support. BID petitions are submitted to the City Clerk for review and must receive approval by the Los Angeles City Council. Ballots are then mailed by the City to the property owners. In order for the BID to be approved, the City must receive a positive response from the majority of the ballots received. 
 
Chinatown BID is seeking a renewal of its BID. The BID will need to submit the petition to renew and the City Council to approve the renewal. Subsequently, the City Clerk will distribute ballots to property owners to vote on the renewal. Chinatown BID is scheduled to renew as of January 2026.The Chinatown BID provides services including sidewalk and gutter sweeping, pressure washing, trash and bulky item removal, graffiti abatement, landscaping and beautification efforts, marketing and promotional programs, special event support, and enhanced public safety patrols. LAUSD properties located within this BID primarily benefit from services related to trash and bulky item removal, graffiti abatement, street and sidewalk sweeping, and public safety patrols. These services contribute to cleaner, safer, and more welcoming environments for students, staff, and visitors.
 
Historically, Los Angeles Unified has negotiated and received a reduced special assessment for each BID in which it owns property. This is because public educational institutions like LAUSD are not direct commercial beneficiaries of BID services such as marketing, business development, or streetscape beautification. As such, the District has consistently worked with the City of Los Angeles and BID administrators to apply a discounted rate structure, one that reflects LAUSD’s limited use of BID-funded services while still contributing a fair share for general maintenance and public safety benefits. Los Angeles Unified will continue to pursue similar reduced assessments for all future BID renewals to ensure fiscal responsibility while maintaining support for community development efforts.
 
The annual amount for the special assessment projected by the BID management teams for the Chinatown BIDs is approximately $26,242.36. Board of Education (Board) authority to support the BID renewal would be conditioned upon the BID agreeing to a reduction in the assessment of at least 50% of the proposed amount in the Chinatown BID, which is approximately $10,193.75 for 2026. If a BID does secure the required support, Los Angeles Unified would still be responsible for encumbering and paying the cost associated with the special assessments. Staff would still attempt to seek discount on the assessments.

*Proposed assessment subject to annual increases based on the BID budget
 
The Chinatown BID is located in Region East and Board District 2 (Dr. Rocío Rivas).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the action will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to execute the petitions in support of renewing the identified BID within the City, conditioned upon the BID providing a discount of at least 50% or more to Los Angeles Unified on the annual assessment, and the District to pay the annual assessment for each BID if the BID is renewed. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote by the Board will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to execute the petition of the BID including all necessary agreements to confirm support of the BID, request the City Clerk to assess Los Angeles Unified an amount that is no more than 50% of the annual assessment, and provide the necessary General Funds to encumber the cost of the special assessment annually. 
 
A ”No” vote may result in the BID failing to obtain a majority affirmative vote of the property owners in the BID to be renewed. However, if the BID does secure the required support, Los Angeles Unified would still be responsible for encumbering and paying the cost associated with special assessments. Staff would continue to seek a discount on the assessments. 
 
Policy Implications: 
Los Angeles Unified does not have a current policy with regard to BIDs. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Piller 3 Engagement and Collaboration Leading for Impact by growing and leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations.
 
Budget Impact: 
If successful in negotiating a discount on the assessment, the projected annual amount for the special assessment of this BIDs would begin at approximately $10,193.75 in 2026, and would be subject to annual increases based on the BID’s budget thereafter. The annual assessment for the BID will be provided by General Fund Business Improvement District Assessment Program 11477. 
 
Student Impact: 
Improve cleanliness and safety around the school perimeter and surrounding neighborhood.
 
Equity Impact:
A BID is a geographically defined area within the City, in which services, activities, and programs are paid for through a special assessment, which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide the agreed-upon services, activities, and programs. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Article 13 D (Proposition 218) of the State Constitution states that “parcels within a Business Improvement District that are owned or used by any public agency, the State of California or the United States shall not be exempt from assessment unless the agency can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that those publicly owned parcels, in fact, receive no special benefit.”
 
Los Angeles Unified is not obligated to support the formation or renewal of a BID. Regardless of Los Angeles Unified’s support, if a BID is otherwise approved, Los Angeles Unified will be required to pay its special assessment unless there has been a formal determination that it is exempt. 
 
The City has limited funding to provide certain services, and BIDs are able to supplement services that may benefit the community. Supporting a BID is voluntary by the Board, however Los Angeles Unified is obligated to pay the special assessment should the City Council vote to pass the BID petitions presented.

Body
Background: 
The Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Lighting within the City of Los Angeles is proposing a street lighting maintenance assessment for the Lighting District to add, maintain, and operate 27 new streetlights along the perimeter of 30 parcels located on Hartford Ave., 4th Street, W 5th Street, Lucas Ave., W 3rd Street, and Witmer Street in Los Angeles. Of these, 20 streetlights would be installed along the perimeter of Gratts Learning Academy for Young Scholars (GLAYS) and Gratts Early Education Center (Schools), as identified in Exhibit A. The Lighting District will need to submit ballots to property owners to vote on the assessment and to install the additional streetlights. The Lighting District provides servicing, installation, maintenance, and operation of street lighting. The cost for services includes but is not limited to electricity, lamps, fixtures, poles, wires, repair crews, and other items necessary to operate streetlights in the City. The additional lighting will further enhance safety measures and support safety passages. 
 
Los Angeles Unified currently pays $2,410.94 annually for 40 existing streetlights in this area. If approved and implemented, the annual amount for the special assessment projected by the Lighting District for the Schools would increase to $9,506.92 annually. This adjustment reflects several key factors: the existing assessment amounts have not been updated for inflation since 1997 due to Prop 218, which froze rates for over 25 years, and the methodology has changed from calculating rates based on property frontage to acreage, resulting in larger parcels incurring higher assessments. Additionally, the inclusion of street lighting, which requires more poles with closer spacing, adds a significant layer of maintenance costs, further contributing to the adjusted rates. The proposed assessment is subject to annual increases based on the Lighting District budget.
 
The Lighting District is located in Region East and Board District 2 (Dr. Rocio Rivas).
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the action will authorize Staff to execute the ballot in support of the proposed lighting assessment provided by the Lighting District and pay the annual assessment for the Lighting District. The increased lighting will help further enhance safe passages to and from school for students attending the Schools.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a yes vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. 
 
A “No” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a no vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. This may result in the Lighting District failing to obtain a majority affirmative vote of the property owners in the Lighting District. However, if the Lighting District does secure the required support, Los Angeles Unified would still be obligated to pay the cost associated with the special assessments.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 3 Engagement and Collaboration Leading for Impact by growing and leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations. Moreover, it supports the District’s Every School Safe: A Blueprint for Safety.
 
Budget Impact: 
The projected annual amount for the assessment of the Lighting District in 2026 would be increased from $2,410.94 to $9,506.92 and subject to increases based on the Lighting District budget annually thereafter. Annual assessment for the Lighting District will be provided by General Fund Street Lighting Assessments Program 15190. This is a new cost, but the program has adequate funding to support this assessment. The assessment is an ongoing annual cost and does not have a sunset date.
 
Student Impact:
Improve safety measures and support safe passages around the school perimeter and surrounding neighborhood.
 
Equity Impact:
A lighting district is a geographically defined area within the City, in which services, maintenance, and operations are paid for through a special assessment, which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide the agreed-upon services, activities, and operations.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Article 13 D (Proposition 218) of the State Constitution requires that a parcel’s assessment may not exceed the reasonable cost for the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel. Article 13 D provides that only special benefits are assessable, and the City must separate the general benefits from the special benefits. It also requires that publicly owned properties, which benefit from the improvements, be assessed.
 
The Bureau of Street Lighting is in the process of creating a Citywide Lighting District, which will require a new Engineer’s Report and an updated methodology for calculating street lighting maintenance assessment rates. Each parcel-including all Los Angeles Unified properties-will be evaluated to determine the proportionate special benefit conferred to each property. The proposed Citywide Lighting District and new Engineer’s Report will require approval by the Mayor’s Office and City Council, to establish the new Citywide Lighting District within the next two-three years. Currently, each parcel’s assessment is calculated in accordance with the Land Use Methodology outlined in the Street Lighting Engineer’s Report. Assessments are primarily based on the parcel’s land use, size (using a table of size ranges rather than a simple per-square-foot calculation), and the equipment type of the lighting system. Additional consideration is given for any benefit-qualifying factors, such as parcel shape and partial lighting. In accordance with City assessment standards, Los Angeles Unified will pay no more than other property owners for comparable parcels and benefits.
 
Los Angeles Unified is not obligated to support the formation of the Lighting District. Regardless of Los Angeles Unified’s support, if the Lighting District is approved, Los Angeles Unified will be required to pay its special assessment unless there has been a formal determination that it is exempt. 
 
The City has limited funding to provide certain services, and the Lighting District is able to supplement services that may benefit the community. Supporting the Lighting District is voluntary by the Board, however Los Angeles Unified is obligated to pay the special assessment should the City Council vote to pass the Lighting District ballot presented.

Brief Description:
(Certification of Unhoused Pupils for Charter School Facilities Program Applications) Recommends adoption of a resolution to fulfill the requirements of the California Code of Regulations Title 2 Section 1859.162.1, for charter school operators independently applying for funding under the Charter Schools Facilities Program (CSFP).
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt attached resolution (Exhibit A) certifying that there will be zero state-recognized unhoused pupils in grades K-12 and in Special Day Class (SDC) Non-severe programs served by charter school projects for which CSFP funding applications will be independently filed by charter schools through October 30, 2025 (Resolution).
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2002, Assembly Bill (AB) 14 created the Charter Schools Facilities Program. Through the passage of Propositions 47 (2002), 55 (2004), 1D (2006), 51 (2016), and 2 (2024), $2 billion in state bond authority has been made available for the construction of new charter facilities or the rehabilitation of school district facilities that are at least 15 years old for charter school use. The Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) is administering a single filing round, which opened on July 3, 2025, to allocate the entire CSFP bond authority from Proposition 2 totaling $600 million.  Applications for this filing round must be submitted to OPSC and the Charter School Finance Authority (CSFA) no later than October 30, 2025.
 
Upon receipt of a charter school’s notice of intent to apply for CSFP funds, the school district must calculate its projected enrollment and, based on existing classroom capacity, determine the number of unhoused pupils within the district. If the calculation identifies unhoused pupils, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or District) will apply the methodology adopted by the Board of Education (Board) in May 2007 (Exhibit B) to determine how many of those unhoused pupils will be served by the proposed charter school project.  Pursuant to 2 CCR Section 1859.162.1, this result must be certified by the governing board through adoption of a resolution presented at a regularly scheduled, publicly held board meeting and submitted to OPSC within ninety (90) days of the charter school’s notification, in this case, by September 7, 2025, which is 90 days after the District received the notification of intent from Animo Jackie Robinson High School. Once approved by the Board, the resolution will be provided to all charter schools that have submitted a notice of intent. 
 
In connection with these requirements, LAUSD staff has received two Letters of Intent for CSFP funding: one from Green Dot Public Schools for a new construction project to serve 621 students at Ánimo Jackie Robinson Charter High School, and another from Citizens of the World Charter Schools Los Angeles for a new construction project to serve 520 students at Citizens of the World Charter School Hollywood. Both projects are proposed to be located on non-District sites and based on the District’s calculation and application of the May 2007 Board-adopted methodology, will serve zero unhoused pupils in grades K-12 and Special Day Class (SDC) Non-Severe categories. In alignment with this finding, the attached Exhibit A is submitted for the Board’s approval.
 
A determination of zero unhoused pupils does not affect the charter school's eligibility to apply under CSFP regulations.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt the Resolution, thus fulfilling the requirements of California Code of Regulations Title 2, Section 1859.162.1. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Board approval of the proposed action will ensure compliance with 2 CCR section 1859.162.1 requirements and will allow charter applicants to proceed with their CSFP applications. There is no impact on LAUSD’s new construction eligibility in grades K-12 and in the SDC Non-severe categories since no unhoused pupils are recognized. If the proposed action is deferred or not approved, LAUSD would be in noncompliance with 2 CCR 1859.162.1, charter applicants would be unable to proceed with CSFP funding applications, and the District could face legal challenges from charter schools asserting that the noncertification of unhoused pupil counts violates state regulations, potentially resulting in litigation and associated cost.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action will not change current LAUSD policy. A Board Resolution certifying the number of state-recognized unhoused pupils is essential in meeting CSFP requirements for charter schools applying on their own behalf.
 
Budget Impact: 
District funding is not required for the adoption of the Resolution.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed action will enable independent charter schools to file CSFP applications for state funding, thus helping provide safe and effective learning environments for charter school students served within the District’s geographical boundaries.
 
Equity Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Once a charter school applicant submits its CSFP application, it will proceed through the state’s regulatory process for scoring, prioritization, and potential award determination. If selected for funding, the project will continue through the state’s funding process, with all required reporting administered by the state and performed by the charter school’s staff. This portion of the process does not involve or impact District staff, students, or budget.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints. A no vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above. Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable
 
Budget Impact: 
Cost Neutral
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
All actions affecting classified personnel and apprentice personnel reported herein are in accordance with Section 45123-45125, 45135, and 45240-45318 of the Education Code and with the Rules of the Personnel Commission.

(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 8 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit.
end
 
Recommendations
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 8 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005, in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document. The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed. During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit. Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A). 
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new multiple subject and special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits. Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to ensure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom. In areas of high need such as multiple subject and special education where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Mr. Schmerelson, Ms. Gonez - September 2025 as Child Welfare and Attendance Month (Res-001-25/26)(Noticed August 26, 2025) 
Body
 
description
Whereas, The Compulsory Education Act was enacted in 1903, and the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District appointed the first Attendance Officer to enforce compliance with the compulsory attendance mandate, creating the Pupil Services and Attendance Division; 
 
Whereas, In September 2017, the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute celebrated 
                      the first National Child Welfare Workforce Development Month, and honored the hard 
work of child welfare professionals in improving outcomes for children, youth, and 
families; 
 
Whereas, In our schools, Child Welfare and Attendance Counselors are called Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors (PSA Counselors). They focus on children’s safety and well-being, strengthening families by providing direct services and referrals, and they reconnect youth to schools; 
 
Whereas, Chronic absenteeism in the Los Angeles Unified School District was at 23.3% in 2024, a 7.7% decline from the previous year, but still above pre-pandemic levels, which were at 18.2% in 2019; 
 
Whereas, The National Child Welfare Workforce Development Month in September 
offers an opportunity to recognize and honor the work of Child Welfare and Attendance 
Counselors, who help our most vulnerable children and their families. It provides an opportunity to educate the community and policymakers about the effectiveness of truancy and dropout prevention interventions, supported by the California Legislature as outlined in the California Education Code (EC) sections 48240-48244; 
 
Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors conduct assessments to identify 
issues that may impact attendance and barriers to learning, to facilitate linkages to services that meet the needs of the whole child while simultaneously integrating multi-tiered interventions to promote overall wellness of the family, to address absenteeism, truancy and to support students of culturally diverse populations; 
 
Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors increase graduation rates and prevent students from dropping out. They increase access to college pathways, link students and families to services, and provide comprehensive services to foster and homeless youth; 
 
Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors create and promote safe schools to empower LGBTQ+ students and families by providing resources, fostering self-advocacy, building resilience, and ensuring their rights;
 
Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors re-engage out-of-school youth back into an educational setting by helping parents, guardians, tutors, and other heads of households by focusing on personalized pathways to further their children's educational, personal, and social growth; 
 
Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors play a pivotal role in supporting the educational journey of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) students by providing tailored resources and advocacy that address both academic challenges and systemic barriers through culturally responsive interventions; and
 
Whereas, The Association of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors (APSAC) has declared the last Tuesday of September as the Child Welfare and Attendance (PSA) Counselor Day; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby 
declares the month of September 2025 as Child Welfare and Attendance Month and 
the last Tuesday of September as the Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors Day; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board will direct the Superintendent and his staff to present on the Los Angeles Unified School District’s declining enrollment and a plan for slowing the decline in enrollment outlining the specific interventions designed to uplift immigrant students and address their needs, during the Committee of the Whole in November 2025; 
 
Resolved further, That in a climate of escalating xenophobia where immigrant students and families are effectively kidnapped and incarcerated in dehumanizing conditions, enduring unimaginable suffering, the District commits to provide child welfare support by assigning five Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors in each region and considering additional assignments based on need by considering the number of students and proportionate amount of ice activity in each region in a genuine effort to address immigrant students and family’s needs; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District will continue to promote attendance awareness through District websites and social media outlets, informed by the perspective of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors, as they continue to conduct home visits, bring students back to school, and re-engage families to strengthen child welfare in our communities.",,,,,,,,

Whereas, Suicide rates increased by 36% between the years 2000 and 2021, responsible for being the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14 and 20 to 34, according to the CDC;
 
Whereas, The phone number of the Suicide and Crisis Hotline has changed to 988, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week;
Whereas, The focus on mental health aligns with the Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD or the District) Strategic Plan on Pillar 1B, which focuses on student happiness at their schools, and Pillar 1C, which seeks to eliminate opportunity gaps. Furthermore, this also aligns with Pillars 2A, which establishes welcoming environments, 2B, the whole-child well-being, and 2C, strong social-emotional skills;
 
Whereas, In July 2017, Michelle King, Superintendent of Schools, approved the implementation of the annual online Suicide Prevention and Awareness Training for all District staff;

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or The District) has a responsibility to ensure students are able to meet their life challenges through grade school and beyond;
 
Whereas, In 2023, the California Department of Education (CDE) reported that only 27 percent of high school students in the state attend a school that offers personal finance courses; 
 
Whereas, In 2023, the California State University (CSU) system approved a rate increase 5 percent every year starting academic year 2023-24 and ending academic year 2028-29 for a total increase of 25% - with undergraduate degrees going from $5,742 to $7,682 per year, graduate degrees from $7,176 to $9,604 per year, and PhDs varying in price but increasing by at least $4,000 per the CSU website - thus increasing the need for borrowing rate for students; 
 
Whereas, Unlawful financial practices burden low-income communities the most and trap families with inescapable debt;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities suffer the most from bank deserts, communities with limited or no banking institutions, that pressure their residents to rely on payday lenders or other companies that offer money loans with high-interest rates;
 
Whereas, Studies show that the borrowing amount, annual percentage rate, or rejection of a home loan has been historically tied to systemic racism, also known as redlining, resulting in harsher loan terms for minority communities despite having similar financial outcomes as their non-minority counterparts;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities have lower opportunities to establish generational wealth, with Hispanic communities having a median household income of $62,800 and African-American communities holding $52,860 in median household income, below the national median of $74,580 according to a 2022 United States Census Bureau report;
 
Whereas, Higher education has been linked with better career and financial outcomes, homeownership, and a longer lifespan, with those who have a bachelor’s degree or higher having more income and are less likely to be unemployed;
 
Whereas, Multiple student surveys conducted by government and non-profit entities report the highest concern about college amongst high school seniors is how to pay for it, and not being able to afford their dream schools;
 
Whereas, In 2021, Los Angeles City launched the Opportunity LA program, a free college savings program for first-grade students; 
 
Whereas, In 2022, California launched the Children Savings Accounts program, known as CalKids, a $2 billion public investment that has provided more than 5 million children in California towards an initial investment into college and career readiness; 
 
Whereas, The California State Legislature, along with the Governor of California, passed Assembly Bill (AB) 2927, requiring financial literacy as a requirement for graduation by school year 2030-31, but by school year 2027-28, will require all high schools to offer a semester-long personal finance course; and
 
Whereas, Financial literacy may be provided to high school seniors and their families through specific courses, at specific schools, and through family academy; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recommends that the Superintendent or a designee begin the process to incorporate economic justice into the current curriculum, such as English Language Arts, mathematics, history, civics, economics, and government classes;
 
Resolved further, That the Los Angeles Unified School District will allow for the teaching of financial literacy and its systems through existing materials and resources for teachers, prioritizing flexibility in how they conduct their lessons for their students, with considerations for all economic backgrounds and approaches from an angle of economic justice;
 
Resolved further, That the District will invest accordingly in professional development for teachers and educators, demonstrating and applying financial literacy and economic justice principles in their lessons, both in person and online participation opportunities; 
 
Resolved further, That the District will work with community-based organizations and nonprofits to help advance appropriate professional development opportunities for staff on how to talk to students about the economic effects on all communities;
 
Resolved further, That using existing data models, the District, along with college/career counselors, will explore constructive ways to prepare students for possible financial outcomes, explained through their future prospects; 
 
Resolved further, That the District will teach students in the newly established financial literacy class the core concepts, including, but not limited to:
 
●                     budgeting
●                     borrowing
●                     interest rates 
●                     banking
●                     taxes
●                     credit
●                     retirement planning

Resolved further, That the District will develop or expand partnerships with reputable financial institutions, non-profit, and/or community-based organizations that specialize in finance to assist students through supplemental programs, including but not limited to after-school programs, adult education, etc;
 
Resolved further, That the District will work to enhance its marketing scope of work in financial literacy, including enhanced outreach to the most in-need families in the district, which will include resources on budgeting, the economy, and many other local factors that may contribute to family finances; 
 
Resolved further, That the District will present an update on the topic of financial literacy no later than February 2026, with a program start date no later than the State-mandated school year 2030-31 graduation requirement; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District will build on future lesson plans with financial literacy and economic justice in consideration for all students and amend as needed, as new financial barriers and opportunities may arise.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District aims to achieve audacious goals for student achievement and wellness with finite resources, including time, funding and demands on personnel; 
 
Whereas, The District is committed to advancing and balancing pillars of the Strategic Plan, including Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration through authentic engagement with families, communities, and educational partners and Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness, encompassing data-driven decision-making and sustainable budgeting; 
 
Whereas, Various resolutions by the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District have called for task forces or committees to solve a problem or advise on an issue of importance to the Board, almost always without a sunsetting date or final task to demonstrate completion;
 
Whereas, At Board direction, District staff prepare, convene and navigate the diverse perspectives of the various task forces and committees on a regular basis, resulting in countless hours of staff time, with little demonstrated evidence of positive impact on student achievement and Board goals; 
 
Whereas, Multiple task forces have been convened to address overlapping topics such as school safety without a consistent process for coordination, and the District currently lacks a consistent structure for sunsetting task forces and advisory committees, resulting in several remaining active indefinitely without formal evaluation or final outcomes;
 
Whereas, Decision-making authority is not always clear, for example the Arts Justice Advisory Committee has been interpreted to exclude District staff as the lead convener, and the Black Student Achievement Plan Steering Committee has spent many hours debating how decisions should be made; and
 
Whereas, To promote efficiency and accountability, it is essential to establish time-bound and outcome-focused parameters for these bodies and a District staff member as the lead who will report back to the board as indicated in the resolves below; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District commits to the efficient and effective use of staff time, Los Angeles Unified School District resources and student-focused priorities by:
 

Eliminating or consolidating duplicative and/or inactive task forces and committees
Clarifying the outcomes, tasks and decision-making process of each task force and committee, including that these entities consider the cost of program rollout and/or staff positions when making recommendations to the Board
Adding end dates or annual board approval to continue these bodies
 
Resolved further, That any task force, committee, and/or advisory/work group established by Board Resolution that does not have a District lead (District employee) shall identify one within 30 days; 
 
Resolved further, That all task forces and advisory committees established through Board resolution shall be reviewed annually, and automatically sunset after two years unless formally extended through Board action, and shall not be extended beyond a total of three years; 
 
Resolved further, That each task force and committee, led by its designated District sponsor, must annually provide the Board with a report (oral or written) on the effectiveness and efficiency of the taskforce/committee including the impact on District resources and staff time, and progress towards intended outcomes;
 
Resolved further, That the District will present its first update on task force and committee elimination, consolidation, task-refinement and end dates at a Committee of the Whole by the first quarter of 2026; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That at a minimum, this update should consolidate the School Culture Climate and Safety Task Force, and the Safe Schools Task Force, , and that this resolution shall not govern committees and task forces created by the Board President, Superintendent, or labor union contracts.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, The United States has observed Latino/a/e Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 since 1988 to commemorate the contributions, heritage, achievements, and cultural influences of Latino Americans in the United States;
 
Whereas, Latine Heritage Month also recognizes the intersectionality and diversity of the U.S. Latine population, incorporating indigenous histories and celebrating the independence days of several Latin American countries including: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua;
 
Whereas, Latinos also include people of African and indigenous descent who are too often ignored when talking about the history, culture, and contributions of Latin American peoples, despite making up about 10% of U.S. Latinos;
 
Whereas, This month-long recognition serves as an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about Latine history, promote cultural awareness and inclusivity, and celebrate diversity both in the present and in our nation’s history;
 
Whereas, U.S. imperialism and military intervention in Latin America, including in countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, and Nicaragua, has led to mass migration of people fleeing civil wars and economic hardship to the United States;
 
Whereas, The U.S. Latine population has grown to become the second largest racial or ethnic group in the United States in the last decade, reaching 62.6 million Latinos as of 2021 and accounting for 19% of all Americans;
 
Whereas, The state of California is home to the largest Latine population in the country, where they comprise 40.3% of the state’s overall population, and almost 50% of the population of the County of Los Angeles;
 
Whereas, Communities like Pico-Union, Boyle Heights, Koreatown, South East Los Angeles, Pacoima, San Fernando, and others are the traditional neighborhoods in Los Angeles of immigrant Latine students and their families;
 
Whereas, Latine students comprise almost 78% of the Los Angeles Unified School District student population, underscoring the importance and relevance of Latine Heritage Month among the District’s students and families;
 
Whereas, Recognizing and celebrating Latine Heritage Month as a District furthers the work of our Strategic Plan to provide culturally relevant, empowering curriculum that inspires students to become leaders and advocates for their communities;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to supporting newcomer students and multilingual learners (MLLs), through the establishment of newcomer programs across the District, including international newcomer academies, that are intended to serve students enrolled in U.S. schools for 3 years or less;
 
Whereas, The District is committed, above and beyond this commemoration, to empowering students through culturally responsive and inclusive learning environments that celebrates the value and diversity of all its students;
 
Whereas, In the current national climate, recognizing and honoring Latine communities is even more critical, as families face intensified attacks on public education and anti-immigrant rhetoric, violent raids, and policies that threaten the safety and full participation of Latino and immigrant students and families;
 
Whereas, Ethnic Studies programs are culturally responsive programs that include the study of Latine history, culture, and contributions, but have come under increasing attack from those championing a sanitized version of American history, threatening the ability of students to access inclusive and empowering curriculum;
 
Whereas, Spanish language instruction plays a critical role in preserving cultural heritage, fostering bilingualism and biliteracy, and supporting students’ academic and social-emotional success, yet is at risk in the face of policy and funding pressures;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes and celebrates that a significant number of Latine students are indigenous, with many speaking indigenous languages reflecting the cultural and linguistic diversity within the Latine community;
 
Whereas, The experiences of Latine students are impacted by their family’s economic status, with low-income Latine students historically facing some of the widest educational disparities; 
 
Whereas, The current political climate has seen an unprecedented and often violent increase in anti-immigrant enforcement actions, policy proposals, and rhetoric that directly impact Latino students, families, and communities, creating fear and barriers to full participation in public education; and
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District remains committed to its status as a sanctuary district, implementing policies and practices that protect immigrant students and families from discrimination, harassment, and enforcement actions on school grounds in addition to providing resources and direct support for those impacted; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes and celebrates September 15 through October 15 as Latino Heritage Month; 
 
Resolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will work to promote educational resources on Latine history, culture, and heritage and make them widely available to staff, students, and families online through the Los Angeles Unified School District homepage and social media accounts; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to fully implement and protect Ethnic Studies curriculum that reflects the histories, struggles, and contributions of Latine communities, recognizing it as a critical component of a well-rounded education for all students; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board affirms that, given the large percentage  of Latine students in LAUSD, Latine history, experiences, and contributions should be integrated and embedded in all areas of the curricula and at all ages, not just during Latine Heritage Month or in Ethnic Studies, and that the District should, therefore, strive to support educators to do so; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board recognizes the importance of Spanish language instruction as both a core academic subject and a cultural bridge for our diverse communities, and commits to protecting and expanding high-quality, culturally affirming Spanish language programs amid current pressures and threats to bilingual education, as well as continued efforts to foster the inclusion of and improve supports for students and families who are primarily speakers of indigenous languages; 
 
Resolved further, That in light of the current political climate and the heightened attacks on Latine and all immigrant students and families, the Board reaffirms its status as a sanctuary district, its unwavering dedication to ensuring that LAUSD remains a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment for every student, regardless of cultural background or immigration status, and to continue advancing policies and practices that protect their rights, dignity, and educational opportunities; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board further reaffirms the need for integrating trauma-informed practices in the curricula and providing mental health support and programs at school sites to support students and their families;
 
Resolved further, That the District acknowledges that ongoing investments in and implementation of LGBTQ+ supports, the Black Student Achievement Plan, and Student Success Centers will impact our Latine students in a positive and powerful way;
 
Resolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will monitor and update the Board on impacts to learning, student and staff attendance, well-being and school climate, and family engagement that may result from current and future federal actions and identify ways LAUSD can mitigate any barriers, provide additional supports,  and ensure all students receive their constitutional rights to a public education; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That by adoption of this resolution, the Board and Superintendent hereby encourage all students, staff, and families, to commemorate and celebrate the immense historical and cultural contributions that Latine people have made and continue to make here in Los Angeles, California, and the United States particularly in light of the targeted assaults this community faces today.",,,,,,,,

The funding is expected to help:* Increase the number of students who will:(a) Acquire technical and career-ready skills through growing CTE pathways(b) Earn industry-recognized certifications to gain employable skills(c) Complete CTE pathways and transition to post-secondary institutions to advance their skills for careers of their choice* Create an experience of a continuum of work-based learning opportunities for participating students* Increase the number of career pathways with industry-standard equipment, materials, and work-based learning integrated into the curriculum* Increase industry sector pathways with high-wage and high-demand occupations as identified by current local labor market research* Develop a deeper understanding of the purpose and benefits of CTE programs among all students and stakeholders* Increase the number of dual enrollment and articulation agreements through partnerships with the Los Angeles Community College District postsecondary schools* Increase the number of District teachers with industry-relevant training and externships* Increase recruitment and retention of CTE teachersBoard Options and Consequences: The Board has the option of voting ""Yes"" to ratify the award of these grant funds or voting ""No"" to decline these funds.A ""No"" vote would decrease students' access to funds for industry-specific, professional-grade materials, equipment, work-based learning, and certifications.A ""Yes"" vote would provide students with access to additional CTEIG-funded materials, equipment, work-based learning, and certifications within their CTE pathways, beginning in the 2025-26 school year.Policy Implications: None.Budget Impact: The CTEIG grant will have no additional budget impact on LAUSD. It operates on a 2:1 matching basis, meaning for every $1 of grant funding received, LAUSD has already incurred $2 in qualifying CTE-related expenditures. Match expenditures (2 to 1) have already been incurred in fiscal year 2025, and the amount was verified before the grant was awarded.Student Impact:* Career exploration and guidance opportunities for students* Pathway alignment with community colleges* Better instruction via elevated teaching through CTEIG-funded training, externships, and professional development* Increased attainment of industry-specific certifications and trainingEquity Impact:Component  ScoreScore RationalRecognition       3This CTEIG grant recognizes historical inequities as the California Department of Education (CDE) deliberates in promoting equity and access to Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. CTE programs are evaluated based, in part, on the measurement of how an applicant provides opportunities for the participation of ""pupils who are individuals with exceptional needs."" ComponentScoreScore Rational Resource Prioritization       3Resource prioritization of this grant is based on student need, as LAUSD prioritizes schools and pathways that have received less funding from other grant sources (e.g., Perkins, Strong Workforce Program, previous CTEIG grants). Grant funds also aid in supporting teacher professional development and conferences aimed at building educator capacity to address achievement gaps among special populations. The grant funds are also utilized to purchase industry-standard equipment and integrate work-based learning curriculum for CTE pathways to ensure all students are prepared for college and careers. Results       3CTE classes and pathways provide opportunities for students to explore careers and develop career-ready skills that lead to living wage employment, which is needed in areas with opportunity and achievement gaps. Total       9Issues and Analysis: To be eligible for funding, LAUSD's high schools with CTE programs must meet a number of requirements as outlined in the CTEIG Request for Applications. These include a $2 for every $1 match requirement and a commitment to provide high-quality CTE programs with a focus on preparing students for college and careers. The application process requires schools to describe how they will improve their CTE programs and demonstrate how their budget aligns with those plans.The grant funding is subject to several limitations and non-allowable expenditures. The funds must be fully expended by December 31, 2026. Non-allowable costs include, but are not limited to:* Supplanting: Using grant funds for existing services that would be paid for by other sources.* General Purpose Costs: Expenditures for items that are not directly and exclusively for the CTE program, such as general classroom furniture (desks, chairs), general-purpose data systems, and routine school utilities or facility repair.* Personnel & Fees: Certain personnel costs, such as bonuses, and fees for teacher credentialing or fingerprinting, are not allowable.* Personal Use: Grant funds cannot be used to acquire or use CTE equipment for personal or administrative purposes.* Matching Funds Pressure: LAUSD must identify and sustain matching funds for each grant dollar. Given the District's CTE footprint, this may create fiscal pressure, particularly as CTEIG requires a 2:1 match ratio. Matching may come from general fund or Perkins but this reduces flexibility in other programmatic areas.Grant recipients must also submit annual expenditure reports and CTE completer data, and any capital outlay requests for single items over $5,000 require pre-approval from the California Department of Education. To ensure the sustainability of the programs, the schools must maintain the CTEIG pathway investments made at their campus for the duration of the grant allocation received.

(Textbooks and Instructional Materials Certification Resolution) Recommends Adoption of the attached resolution (Attachment A) certifying the sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached resolution certifying the sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials in the core and required subject areas.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Pursuant to Education Code Section 60119, the Board of Education is required to annually make a determination, through a resolution after a public hearing, whether all students in District schools have sufficient textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in the core and required subject areas. These areas include mathematics, science, history/social science, reading/language arts, including the English Language Development (ELD) component, health, and world language (6-12).  Moreover, the public hearing must be scheduled at a time that will encourage the attendance of teachers and parents and guardians of pupils who attend District schools, and it shall not take place during or immediately following school hours.
 
The District has taken the following significant actions to ensure sufficient textbooks in the targeted core and required subjects:
 
•                     Allocated $87 million in FY 2025-26 for Core and Required textbooks.
•                     Required all teachers to certify textbook sufficiency in their classrooms.
•                     Required all principals to certify textbook sufficiency in their schools.
•                     Required Region Superintendents to resolve identified insufficiencies in a timely manner.
•                     Required Region Superintendents to certify sufficiency in their respective regions.
•                     Provided Region personnel with clear policies and procedures.
•                     Development of a centralized database to track all appropriate textbook requests, certifications, and Los Angeles County of Education (LACOE) audit results.
•                     Conducted follow-up on all insufficiencies identified as a result of norm day enrollment projections.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The Board will adopt the attached resolution declaring the District has sufficient textbooks, thus meeting compliance with Education Code Section 60119.
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles is required to conduct a public hearing to certify compliance with Education Code Section 60119. If the District is found to have insufficient textbooks in the core and required subject areas and cannot remedy the insufficiency within three days of the Board of Education’s meeting, the county superintendent would request the California Department of Education (CDE) purchase the textbooks or instructional materials necessary to comply with the sufficiency requirement. The funds used to make this purchase of instructional materials would be considered a loan that LAUSD would need to repay to the CDE. The CDE would also issue a public statement at the next State Board of Education meeting indicating that the LAUSD Superintendent and Board of Education failed to provide students with sufficient instructional materials.
 
Policy Implications: 
There is no change in District policy of targeting funding to purchase textbooks to ensure full compliance with Education Code Section 60119.
 
Budget Impact: 
General Fund and Lottery apportionment from the State are the budgeting expenditures for textbooks, 4000 - object code. Of the $87 million allocated in FY 2025-26 for Core and Required textbooks, as of September 2, 2025, approximately $17.4 million has been expended.
 
Student Impact:
Not Applicable.

Main Street, Los Angeles (Gompers), 911 S. Hoover Street, Los Angeles (Hoover), 1049 N. Fairfax Avenue, West Hollywood (Fairfax COS), and 5717 Rudnick Avenue, Woodland Hills (Collins), (collectively, the Sites), maximizing affordable housing units for Los Angeles Unified employees (Employees).endBodyBackground: On June 8, 2021, the Board of Education (Board) authorized the Facilities Services Division to conduct the due diligence activities necessary to identify options for providing affordable employee and family housing (referred to as the Housing Initiative). From November 2023 and January 2024, Los Angeles Unified issued a Request for Expression of Interest (REI) to gauge development sector interest in redeveloping nine District-owned sites. Responses demonstrated strong interest from experienced developers along with potential financing strategies.Between May to September 2024, the District conducted comprehensive surveys and focus groups to assess employee and family housing needs (Survey).  Results showed significant demand and ongoing housing insecurity. In April 2025, Los Angeles Unified retained the Volz Company, LLC, in association with Gensler, (Volz) to complete a feasibility study including site and financial analyses of the nine original sites, four of which were identified as viable for development.  Further analysis found that affordable housing projects prioritized for employees are both feasible and timely.  These four sites are recommended to proceed into an RFQP that aligns with the District's Housing Initiative goals (Goals):1. Attract and retain qualified teachers and staff2. Enhance Los Angeles Unified competitiveness as an employer3. Support work-life balance and employee wellness4. Reduce commute times and environmental impact5. Foster community ties between employees and neighborhoods6. Maximize use of District resources to support students and staff The RFQP will invite proposals to design, construct, finance, and manage housing developments on one or more sites, prioritizing Employee occupancy. Proposers may recommend development and financing models that best support the District's goals.Upon selection of a successful Proposer, staff will request authorization from the Board to enter into development agreements.Gompers is located in Region South, Board District 7 (Tanya Ortiz Franklin), Hoover is located in Region West, Board District 5 (Karla Griego), Fairfax COS is located in Region West, Board District 4 (Nick Melvoin), and Collins is located in Region North, Board District 4 (Nick Melvoin). Expected Outcomes:Approval of the action will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP for the development of the Sites. Selection of a development partner through the RFQP process will advance the Los Angeles Unified's efforts to address the housing affordability challenges faced by many employees, strengthen workforce recruitment and retention, and reinforce Los Angeles Unified's commitment to its Housing Initiative goals.Board Options and Consequences: A ""yes"" vote will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP for the development of the Sites and continue advancing Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative.A ""no"" vote will not authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to issue an RFQP.  As a result, Los Angeles Unified will not continue seeking opportunities that provide affordable Employee housing.Policy Implications: Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative has identified a growing need to provide affordable Employee housing. The proposed action advances the Housing Initiative and opportunities for achieving its Goals. Budget Impact: The activities associated with preparing the RFQP and negotiating agreements with the Project Proposers require staff time from the Facilities Services Division and the Office of the General Counsel which are General Fund overhead expenses. Student Impact: Providing stable and affordable Employee housing helps mitigate negative externalities on students that arise from Employee housing insecurity and creates the opportunity for Employees to instead focus on student success. Furthermore, increasing workforce housing security will correspondingly decrease Employee turnover, creating significant efficiencies that can be directed to support student wellness and academic achievement by fostering a more stable, engaged, and connected school community.Equity Impact:By creating equitable access to affordable, stable, and nearby housing, the initiative supports a more diverse and inclusive workforce, strengthens employee retention, and fosters greater continuity and connection within school communities, ultimately contributing to improved outcomes for all students.Issues and Analysis:The 2024 Survey results indicated that almost half (46%) of employee respondents have considered leaving their job due to high housing costs and over 6,000 employees (52%) expressed interest in Los Angeles Unified affordable housing.  The development of workforce housing may allow Employees to live in affordable, safe, and stable housing within the communities they work in. Los Angeles Unified invests millions of dollars annually in general and grant funds to recruit, hire, train and develop teachers and staff. These investments are diminished when Employees leave Los Angeles Unified employment.  Research from the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley has shown that access to housing affordability is a key factor in improving employee retention, particularly among early-career educators and classified staff. Workforce housing represents a strategic investment in sustaining a strong, consistent, and effective workforce to support student success.To help address the issues above, and to achieve Los Angeles Unified's Goals, the RFQP will include key evaluation criteria such as:1. Alignment with Los Angeles Unified's Housing Initiative Goals.2. Optimization of sites to provide affordable Employee housing.3. Prioritization of tenancy by Employees earning between the 30-120% Area Median Income brackets.4. Prioritization of tenancy and rent-setting control for Los Angeles Unified Employees.5. Assurance that no out-of-pocket financial contribution will be required by Los Angeles Unified.6. Preservation of the long-term value of the property and ownership for Los Angeles Unified.7. Experience with and commitment to full and sole responsibility for ongoing operations, management, and maintenance of the development(s).8. Plans for robust community engagement.Staff will continue to work with Volz to issue the RFQP and evaluate the proposals.  If financial viability cannot be achieved while providing 100% affordable Employee units on any of the Sites, special considerations will be given to allow for the following:1. Inclusion of Market-rate units, and2. Land exchanges.Upon selection of the successful Proposer, staff will return to the Board for authorization to enter into applicable agreements to develop the Projects.Although staff expects that there may be interest in developing affordable housing on each of the Sites, there is also a possibility that there are no proposals received and/or there is no Proposer selected for one or more (or all) of the Sites.  If that should happen, staff will provide the Board with an Informative related to the responses, if any, the results, and potential future steps which may include issuing additional RFQP's.

Action Proposed: 
Authorize the following:
1.                     Approve a new MOU between the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or the District) and the LADWP for a term of 4.5 years, beginning October 27, 2025 to April 26, 2030.
 
2.                     Amend the Facilities SEP to allocate $20 million in bond program funds to support LADWPs direct installation of energy-efficient lighting upgrades at up to 150 school sites that will be executed over the term of the proposed new MOU. 
 
3.                     Authorize the Senior Advisor to the Superintendent and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement this MOU.   
end
 
Body
Background: 
 In 2012, the District entered into an MOU with the LADWP under which the LADWP reimbursed the District for up to $8 million in energy efficiency projects over a two-year term and six-month extension. On February 10, 2015, the Board ratified the MOU with LADWP valued at $45.3 million to effectuate the “Conserving for Our Kids Program,” a multi-pronged strategy to raise energy and water efficiency at District facilities (Board Report No. 321-14/15). An MOU was subsequently executed between the LADWP and the District with a three-year term, and Amendment No. 1 extended the term by two years, for a total term of five years from October 2015 through October 2020 (Board Report No. 290-18/19, April 23, 2019); the activities associated with administering the MOU were funded by M&O Routine Repair and General Maintenance funds. Another MOU valued at $87.5 million, where LADWP contributed up to $72.5 million and the District contributed up to $15 million for energy efficient lighting upgrades, was executed between the LADWP and the District (Board Report No. 108-20/21) to continue the successes of this program for a five-year term from October 2020 through October 2025. A new MOU is now needed to continue these energy and water efficiency efforts, specifically the Direct Install Lighting projects which have been implemented at 157 school sites dating back to 2012. Under the terms of the new MOU, LADWP will invest more funding in energy and water efficiency projects as well as new greening and climate resiliency projects that will help reduce rising utility costs and improve Green House Gas reductions.
 
The new MOU will continue the installation of energy and water efficiency measures at eligible District sites in the LADWP service area. LADWP and its qualified contractors and/or subcontractors will perform the work, and LADWP will reimburse a portion of the District’s administrative and labor costs associated with supporting the projects. The MOU was presented to and approved by the LADWP Board of Supervisors on July 8, 2025.
 
The term of the proposed new MOU is 4.5 years; each calendar year within the term is a “term year.” The total value of this MOU is $120 million between both agencies of which LADWP will invest approximately $100 million towards District upgrades and programs (up to $22.5 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $10 million in term year 5) and Los Angeles Unified will contribute approximately $20 million (up to $4.5 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $2 million in term year 5) in in-kind services and matching funds.
 
The MOU consists of four primary programmatic strategies and maximum funding amounts per year as follows:
 
•                     Direct install energy-efficient lighting upgrade projects: LADWP will contribute up to $18 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $8 million for term year 5 for upgrades at up to 150 school sites. The District shall support the extension of this program with matching funds or in-kind services that shall not exceed a total of 25% of the program’s costs or $4.5 million, whichever is less, per term year (term years 1-4), and up to $2 million or 25% of program costs for term year 5.  
 
Energy efficient lighting upgrade projects will be selected within LADWP service areas with a focus on school sites with high energy use and/or those with high priority that are located within disadvantaged areas and in alignment to help meet the District’s renewable and greening goals. The proposed energy efficiency upgrades will improve the instructional environment at up to 150 schools, lower the District’s carbon footprint, and reduce recurring expenditures for electricity by an estimated $5.5 million annually. 
 
•                     Education and awareness of energy efficiencies: LADWP will contribute up to $1.125 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $500,000 in term year 5. The cost of these efforts will be borne entirely by LADWP. However, front funding by LAUSD may be necessary, and would likely be funded by energy rebates associated with the Eco-Sustainability Office.
•                     Greening/climate resiliency activities: LADWP will contribute up to $2.25 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $1 million for term year 5. The cost of these activities will be borne entirely by LADWP.  These activities may include, but are not limited to: 
o                     Tree opportunities assessments on campuses.
o                     Empty tree well planting.
o                     Turf or pavement removal for new tree wells & trees.
o                     Installation of micro forests.
o                     Educational projects about trees and participating in City Plants.
o                     Educational native and climate-ready gardens/landscapes.
o                     National Wildlife Federation (NWF) Certified landscapes.
o                     On-site stormwater capture and recharge.
o                     Best management practices.
o                     Low impact development infrastructure.
o                     Urban heat island mitigation measures.
o                     Piloting technologies supporting resilience.
o                     Related training for LAUSD maintenance and operations staff.
 
•                     LADWP water conservation incentives: LADWP will contribute up to $1.125 million per year for term years 1-4 and up to $500,000 for term year 5 for the installation of high-efficiency fixtures and devices. The cost of these efforts will be borne entirely by LADWP.  However, front funding by LAUSD may be necessary, and would likely be funded by energy rebates associated with the Eco-Sustainability Office.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 4, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit A. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit B. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these proposed actions will enable the LADWP to continue to support existing and proposed energy efficiency upgrades, new greening and climate resiliency projects, and conservation awareness initiatives through April 2030. On an annual basis, the Eco-Sustainability Office and Facilities will report on the progress of the energy efficient lighting upgrade program related to this MOU.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of these proposed actions will improve processes delineated by the MOU and enable the LADWP to provide proposed energy and water efficiency upgrades, greening and climate resiliency projects, and conservation awareness initiatives through the term of the MOU.
 
If the recommended actions are not approved, replacement of lighting and plumbing fixtures will not be provided at schools with the identified need beyond the current LADWP/LAUSD MOU expiration date of October 26, 2025 and thus the District will not benefit from the cost avoidance that results from such upgrades in fixtures, technologies, and end-user behavior. In addition, students will no longer receive the benefit of education and awareness programs and initiatives supported by the current MOU.
 
Policy Implications: 
These proposed actions are consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The proposal also aligns with the Board Resolution adopted on December 3, 2019, that commits to the goals of “achieving 100 percent clean, renewable energy in its electricity sector by 2030 and in all energy sectors by 2040 working in collaboration with the LADWP’s Sustainable City Plan” (1st Recital to Resolution 018-19/20). 
 
These proposed actions further align with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses).
 
The proposal also advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 1: Academic Excellence by developing educational programs around climate literacy; Strategic Plan Pillar 2: Joy and Wellness by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, indoor and outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools; Strategic Plan Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration by empowering students to take leadership roles as climate champions and environmental stewards; Strategic Plan Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness by implementing energy efficiency and water conservation projects to reduce utility costs to the General Fund; and Strategic Plan Pillar 5: Investing in Staff by creating a sustainability program for professionals that will target the development of climate literacy throughout the schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
Per the MOU, LADWP agrees to fund a maximum of $100 million which includes the work to be executed as well as reimbursing the District for project administrative costs. The District agrees to provide up to $20 million to support energy efficient lighting upgrades at up to 150 school sites. The District’s contribution will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components.  While the District’s contribution to this MOU is only for the energy efficient lighting system upgrade projects, some front funding may be required to support implementation of the other three programmatic strategies under the MOU.  
 
Student Impact:
Cost savings from the efficiency programs implemented by the MOU will reduce recurring expenditures for electricity by an estimated $5.5 million annually, thus allow for more financial resources to be allocated to support educational programs. Moreover, students may acquire knowledge through the sustainability and conservation awareness initiatives made possible by the MOU. Active involvement in addressing environmental issues encourages students to become environmental stewards, and such experience can assist in career development preparation for green jobs and sustainability.
 
Equity Impact:
The new MOU will continue the installation of energy and water efficiency measures as well as greening and climate resiliency projects at eligible District sites in the LADWP service area with a focus on school sites with high energy use and/or those with high priority on the District’s Green School Yards Index. A portion of the selected schools shall be located in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the LADWP. Educational and awareness programs will be available to all eligible schools interested in participating.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The MOU would improve processes and extend LADWP’s implementation and funding of energy and water conservation projects, greening and climate resiliency projects, and awareness initiatives, as follows:
•                     In addition to its own qualified employees, LADWP will provide qualified contractors and/or subcontractors who will provide workers that are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) to install agreed upon energy efficiency measures at District school sites. LADWP will bear sole responsibility for its contractors and subcontractors;
•                     The District’s Labor Compliance Department will enforce the payment of prevailing wages to all LADWP contractors and subcontractors, and LADWP, as the awarding body, will cooperate with the Labor Compliance Department pursuant to the terms and requirements outlined in the MOU;
•                     LADWP and/or its contractors and subcontractors will procure mutually agreed upon materials per approved scopes of work to perform the direct installation work;
•                     The District may perform the direct installation work if LADWP does not meet agreed-upon milestones. If the District performs the direct installation work, it will purchase materials and all District materials and labor costs will be reimbursed by LADWP;
•                     The District’s invoicing for reimbursement by LADWP will be bi-monthly (i.e., every other month); and
•                     The District’s labor costs related to the direct installation work will be reimbursed according to the most current District negotiated unburdened hourly rates for identified positions at the time the work is being performed.

Brief Description:
description
(Adoption of the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan) Recommends adoption of the 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP). This plan supports the District with the eligibility for certain federal disaster assistance. The District received conditional approval of the LHMP update from the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) pending formal adoption by the Board of Education (Board). 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve and adopt the Resolution of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education (Attachment A) adopting the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (Attachment B) prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390), the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007, and the latest FEMA guidance effective April 2025. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2004, the District developed a LHMP, which received FEMA approval in 2005. Subsequent LHMPs were prepared and received FEMA approval, and the latest version was adopted and approved in November 2018. The LHMP is typically valid for a period of five years and in order to keep it current, an update is required to reflect the current responsibilities of the District’s divisions, departments and offices and address major natural and human-caused disasters that have the potential to impact District facilities and operations. The updated plan was prepared to ensure the District would be eligible for FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation and Hazard Mitigation Grant programs, explicitly, FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP); Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program; Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program; as well as the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The LHMP also provides the foundation for the District’s long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses. 
Hazard mitigation planning is the process through which hazards that threaten communities are identified, likely impacts determined, mitigation goals set, and appropriate mitigation strategies determined, prioritized, and implemented. This LHMP documents the hazard mitigation planning process and identifies relevant hazards, risks and vulnerabilities, and strategies LA Unified will use to decrease vulnerability and increase resiliency and sustainability in the District and the communities it serves. The planning process began with the organizational phase to establish the Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee. Members were selected following FEMA's guidance which specifies the type of participants needed. Key District and agency stakeholders were invited to LHMP planning meetings and those that chose to participate became committee members. The entire process involved seven meetings. A detailed risk assessment was then conducted followed by the development of a focused mitigation strategy for the District’s Planning Area. 
The District submitted the updated LHMP to CalOES and FEMA for their review and approval. The LHMP was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390), the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007, and the latest FEMA LHMP guidance effective April 2025.On July 18, 2025, the LHMP received conditional approval from FEMA subject to Board adoption.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will approve and adopt the attached Resolution to adopt the LHMP pursuant to requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This action is required for the LHMP to receive formal FEMA approval.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote to adopt the Resolution will enable the District to receive final approval from FEMA for the LHMP and allow the District to apply for funding for pre-disaster mitigation for projects identified in the LHMP as well as grant requests associated with post-disaster funding should a major natural or human-made disaster occur. Moreover, the adopted 2025 LHMP will provide the District with the planning framework for addressing and/or responding to natural disasters. 
 
A “No” vote would not allow the District to receive final approval from FEMA and apply for federal disaster assistance, specifically, the FEMA HMGP, PDM, BRIC, and FMA programs. Additionally, if the Board does not approve and adopt the Resolution adopting the Los Angeles Unified School District 2025 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan, the District will need to rely on the outdated 2018 plan, which does not consider new and changing natural hazards. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy. This action helps document the hazard mitigation planning process and identifies relevant hazards, risks and vulnerabilities as well as strategies LA Unified will use to decrease vulnerability and increase resiliency and sustainability in the District and the communities it serves.
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 will serve to augment the District’s emergency planning efforts by formally adopting the LHMP. Continued and enhanced hazard mitigation actions will help ensure that students are provided with a safe and healthy school environment and safe facilities that promote effective learning.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Each year in the United States, natural disasters take the lives of hundreds of people and injure thousands more. Nationwide, taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to help communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals recover from disasters. These monies only partially reflect the true cost of disasters because additional expenses to insurance companies and non-governmental organizations are not reimbursed by tax dollars. Many natural disasters are predictable, and much of the damage caused by these events can be alleviated or even eliminated. The purpose of hazard mitigation is to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards. Adoption and implementation of the District’s 2025 LHMP will demonstrate the District’s commitment to fulfilling its mitigation goals and objectives to meet that end.

(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000; New Contracts; Contract Amendments;  Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments:  Purchase Orders; Good and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approval of Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000): New Contracts as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority of the Superintendent.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates.
 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:  
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Contract Amendments; Purchase orders; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transations - Purchase orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance: District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Materials Purchase Orders
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including fire life safety training and video creation services and materials testing and special inspection services contracts.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013 Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 08, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact:
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Review and adopt the Negative Declaration (ND) for the proposed Fairfax High School Major Modernization Project (Project) prepared in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) and State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 §15000 et seq.). An initial Study/Negative Declaration was prepared for the Fairfax High School Major Modernization Project. Environmental review of the Project found that there would be no significant impacts as a result of construction and operation of the Project.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 12, 2021, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education (Board) approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary at Fairfax High School (Fairfax HS or Campus) for a major modernization project (Board Report No. 85-21/22). Subsequently, on January 14, 2025, the Board approved the Design-Build Contract Award to Pinner Construction Co., Inc. in partnership with DLR Group Inc. for the major modernization project (Board Report No. 100-24/25) with a contract value of $142,998,000.The proposed Project is located on a 23.63-acre school campus at 7850 Melrose Avenue within the City of Los Angeles (Board District 4, Region West). Fairfax High School (School) originally opened in 1924. All existing buildings were constructed between 1923 and 2011. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the school served approximately 1,500 students in grades 9 through 12. The proposed Project includes the construction of a new gymnasium, five specialty classrooms, outdoor physical education courts, and maintenance and operations (M&O) facilities. The new two-story gymnasium building includes team rooms and locker rooms; a public entrance and lobby providing access to the building from the west parking area along Fairfax Avenue; and five new classrooms that will host Ceramics, Drama, Instrumental Music, Sports Medicine, and Dance classes. The outdoor physical education courts will be comprised of basketball/volleyball courts, adjacent areas with trees and seating. Demolition activities will include the removal of the Shop Building, Gymnasium, M&O Building, Ticket Office, and Relocatable Sanitary Building, including foundations and below-grade and above-grade utility infrastructure associated with these buildings and structures. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impacts during construction. Additional improvements encompass exterior painting of all remaining buildings to provide a uniform appearance; associated landscape, hardscape, parking improvements, and related infrastructure upgrades including a new electrical transformer. The site is not on any hazardous waste lists under Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. A Preliminary Environmental Assessment-Equivalent (PEA-E) was prepared for the proposed Project in accordance with Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) guidelines. The PEA-E did not identify any hazardous substances in the soil, and No Further Action was recommended for the site assessment investigation. However, the site is in a designated City of Los Angeles Methane Zone, and a methane assessment has been performed. Methane monitoring and mitigation components, as required by the City of Los Angeles, will be incorporated as a part of the project design. The District’s Office of Environmental Health & Safety (OEHS) evaluated the proposed Project to determine its potential impact on the environment in accordance with CEQA, Public Resources Code §21000, et seq., and State CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations §15000 et seq. Environmental review of the Project found that there would be no significant impacts as a result of construction and operation of the Project with the implementation of LAUSD’s Standard Conditions of Approval. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of a ND (State Clearinghouse Number 2025050380). The District circulated the IS/ND for a 30-day public review period from May 7, 2025, to June 6, 2025. Copies of the IS/ND and PEA-E were available for review electronically on the OEHS website and on the State Clearinghouse website and printed copies were made available for public review at OEHS District Headquarters at Beaudry and at Fairfax High School. The District posted the Notice of Intent to Adopt a Negative Declaration (NOI) on the OEHS website during the public review period, mailed the NOI to all owner/occupants located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Project site, to parents/guardians of students, and published the NOI in two local newspapers (Daily News and La Opinión). The District filed the NOI with the Los Angeles County Clerk and with the State Clearinghouse for distribution to potentially affected state agencies, local agencies, tribal agencies pursuant to AB 52, and known interested parties. At the end of the public review period, the District received comment letters from two agencies and verbal comments from individuals during the community meeting. All letters and verbal comments were responded to by the District and are included in the attached Responses to Comments (RTC). The requirements set forth in the CEQA Guidelines Section 15073.5 regarding recirculation are not met.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will review and make a determination on the attached Resolution to adopt the ND pursuant to CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This action is required for the Board to consider approval of the Project. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote to adopt the Negative Declaration would enable the Board to consider approval of the Project. 
 
A “No” vote to adopt the Negative Declaration would prevent the Board from approving the proposed Project, and the proposed Project could not proceed into construction.
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy. This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). On August 24, 2021, the Board adopted an update to the SUP to integrate Measure RR funding and priorities into its operational framework and approved the Measure RR Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) to help guide the identification of sites and development of project proposals (Board Report No. 027-21/22). The Implementation Plan included, among other things, the development of seven major modernization projects, one in each Board District and the Project is in Board District 4. 
 
Budget Impact: 
This action does not have a budget impact.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed Project, once completed, will help ensure that the students attending the school are provided with a safe and healthy environment, and up-to-date facilities that promote learning. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In 2016, the Board authorized a proposal by Arts Fairfax to donate a new 3,300 square foot art gallery and classroom building (Gallery Building) at the School, consisting of an exhibition/classroom space, office space, conference room, storage, and restrooms. Additionally, the Board authorized the inclusion of the Gallery Building design in the construction bid documents for the Project as an add alternate. The Gallery Building scope of work was included as part of the CEQA analysis for potential environmental impacts and as referenced in the CEQA documents (IS/ND). Construction of the Gallery Building will only proceed if additional funding becomes available through future external and/or District sources.
 
Environmental review of the proposed Project found that, with the incorporation of Los Angeles Unified’s Standard Conditions and Approvals, Project Design Features, as well as all applicable state, federal, and local regulations, there would be no significant impacts as a result of the Project.
 
The District is the “Lead Agency” as defined in the State CEQA Guidelines §§15050-15053, and the Board shall review and consider the Negative Declaration and its supporting documents and comments.

The current project budget is $177,555,145. 2) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments to implement the proposed Project, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.   3) Adopt the Office of Environmental Health and Safety's (OEHS) evaluation of the proposed Project which resulted in the preparation of a ND. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, and to permit construction activities to commence, this proposed action may only be considered after the Board adopts the ND prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project (Board Report No. 041-25/26). endBodyBackground: On October 12, 2021, the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified) Board approved the project definition for site due diligence, planning, and feasibility activities necessary at Fairfax High School (School or Campus) for a major modernization project. Subsequently, on June 13, 2023 the Board approved the redefinition of the Project to include the full scope, schedule, and budget to complete the Project, and on January 14, 2025 approved the Design-Build Contract Award to Pinner Construction Co., Inc. in partnership with DLR Group Inc. with a contract value of $142,998,000. Fairfax High School is located on a 23.63-acre school campus at 7850 Melrose Avenue within the City of Los Angeles (Board District 4, Region West). The School originally opened in 1924. All existing buildings were constructed between 1923 and 2011. As of the 2024-2025 Electronic Capacity Assessment Review (E-CAR), the school served approximately 1,500 students in grades 9 through 12.   The proposed Project includes the construction of a new gymnasium, five specialty classrooms, outdoor physical education courts, and maintenance and operations (M&O) facilities. The new two-story gymnasium building includes team rooms and locker rooms; a public entrance and lobby providing access to the building from the west parking area along Fairfax Avenue; and five new classrooms that will host Ceramics, Drama, Instrumental Music, Sports Medicine, and Dance classes. The outdoor physical education courts will be comprised of basketball/volleyball courts, adjacent areas with trees and seating. Demolition activities will include the removal of the Shop Building, Gymnasium, M&O Building, Ticket Office, and Relocatable Sanitary Building, including foundations and below-grade and above-grade utility infrastructure associated with these buildings and structures. Interim facilities will be installed to allow the School to remain operational and minimize impacts during construction.Additional improvements encompass exterior painting of all remaining buildings to provide a uniform appearance; associated landscape, hardscape, parking improvements, and related infrastructure upgrades including a new electrical transformer.Expected Outcomes:Approval of the proposed Project will permit construction activities to be undertaken once the Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval is secured. Construction activities are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2026 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 2029.  Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of staff's proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured. If the proposed action is not adopted, staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities. As a result, the School will continue to operate with aging, deteriorating, and outdated buildings and grounds. Furthermore, students, staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project.Policy Implications: This action helps facilitate the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan and supports the goals and objectives of the School Upgrade Program (SUP). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading facilities to support the instructional program.Budget Impact: The proposed action does not have a budget impact as the Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it approved the Project definition and authorized the design-build contract award. The current budget for the proposed Project is $177,555,145. The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the SUP for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses.   Student Impact: The proposed Project will help ensure that approximately 1,500 existing and future students attending the School are provided with safe and updated facilities that support learning.Equity Impact:The intent of the major modernization project is to address buildings and grounds that pose a safety concern and have the greatest need for upgrades with emphasis placed on seismic safety, reducing Los Angeles Unified's reliance on relocatable buildings, and addressing the most critical/severe physical conditions. While the proposed Project is extensive in nature, less critical items may not be addressed. This approach allows Los Angeles Unified to reach more schools with the limited funding available.Issues and Analysis: OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines. This evaluation, as documented in the Initial Study (IS), resulted in the preparation of the ND. The ND was circulated for a 30-day public review period from May 7, 2025, to June 6, 2025. The analysis documented in the IS/ND found that the proposed Project would not result in significant environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project. Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction, the Board must adopt the ND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project.   In 2016, the Board authorized a proposal by Arts Fairfax to donate a new 3,300 square foot art gallery and classroom building (Gallery Building) at the School, consisting of an exhibition/classroom space, office space, conference room, storage, and restrooms. Additionally, the Board authorized the inclusion of the Gallery Building design in the construction bid documents for the Project as an add alternate. The Gallery Building scope of work was included as part of the CEQA analysis for potential environmental impacts and as referenced in the CEQA documents (IS/ND). Construction of the Gallery Building will only proceed if additional funding becomes available through future external and/or District sources.Attachments:NoneSubmitted:08/26/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Four Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends to approve four Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) Projects totaling $650,000 at four elementary schools (Latona Avenue, Oxnard, San Antonio, and Van Nuys) and authorize staff to execute all necessary implementation instruments.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve four SEEDS Projects at Latona Avenue Elementary School, Oxnard Elementary School, San Antonio Elementary School, and Van Nuys Elementary School (Projects), as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for the four proposed Projects is $650,000.
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive, Chief Procurement Officer, and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed SEEDS Projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The SEEDS Program supports the development of projects that will enhance school sites by creating outdoor learning spaces in collaboration with school-based and community-led efforts (Program). There are two components to the Program:
 
1.                     Development of the outdoor learning space constructed by Los Angeles Unified includes capital investments, such as asphalt removal, installation of irrigation and utilities, and any associated testing and inspection.
 
2.                     Collaboration with a school site and/or partner organization that will outfit the outdoor learning space with the plant materials and landscaping features that align with the school’s instructional vision and program. This component is essential to the success of each project.
 
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school site by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit a SEEDS application to receive up to $100,000 to create or improve an outdoor learning space. An additional $50,000 is available to schools ranked in the top 150 on the Los Angeles Unified Greening Index of schools in need of green space as published in August 2022 (Greening Index).
 
The Greening Index ranks the four schools as follows: Latona Avenue Elementary School (356), Oxnard Elementary School (104), San Antonio Elementary School (204), and Van Nuys Elementary School (310). Therefore, Oxnard Elementary School is eligible for the additional $50,000 allocation.
 
District staff evaluates the proposals based on the specific criteria and requirements outlined in the SEEDS Program Guide to ensure each proposal meets the eligibility requirements. Proposals must include a written project narrative describing the project scope, an explanation of how the project will be integrated into the school’s curriculum, and confirmation of the availability of resources to outfit and maintain the outdoor learning space. The recommended Projects included in this Board Report have been reviewed and have been found to comply with the program requirements, including feasibility and equitable distribution throughout the District.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 4, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of this proposed action will enable staff to proceed with the design and construction of these four proposed Projects. Approval of these greening Projects will improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff, increase sustainability, and enhance the outdoor school environment.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to execute these proposed Projects that support educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science. If these proposed projects are not approved, the school sites will not benefit from the creation of these outdoor learning spaces.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action is consistent with the District's long-term goal to address the unmet needs of school facilities and provide students with safe and healthy learning environments. The action is also aligned with Board Resolutions that reiterate Los Angeles Unified’s commitment to creating green learning spaces (Expand Sustainable Schoolyards and Environmental Initiatives and Curriculum Board Resolution, Creating New School Gardens and Campus and Community-Shared Green Spaces to Provide Outdoor Learning Opportunities and Create Sustainable and Healthy Environments, and Green Schools for All: Equitable Funding and Expansion of Green Spaces across District Campuses). The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 2 Joy and Wellness Welcoming Learning Environments by developing safe and sustainable green spaces, outdoor learning environments, and shaded areas at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The combined project budget for the four proposed Projects is $650,000. The Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked in the School Upgrade Program (SUP), specifically for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
The project budget for Latona Avenue Elementary School includes a contribution of $200,000 from Bond Program funds earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 2 which will be transferred to funds earmarked in the SUP for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed SEEDS projects at Latona Avenue Elementary School, Oxnard Elementary School, San Antonio Elementary School, and Van Nuys Elementary School will provide outdoor learning spaces that create environments for student-centered, experiential, and engaged learning. These SEEDS learning gardens will facilitate educational programs related to nutrition, health, literacy, math, and science, and may also be used during recess and lunchtime by approximately 1,300 current and future students. These proposed Projects also encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces.
 
Equity Impact:
Potential projects are identified through proposals submitted by schools and/or partners. A school by itself, or in cooperation with a partner organization, may submit an application for a SEEDS project for up to $100,000. Schools ranked in the top 150 on the Greening Index will receive an additional $50,000 for their SEEDS project. One of the four proposed Projects included in this Board Report qualifies for this additional funding.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
In order to ensure the long-term permanence of each SEEDS project, the school site and/or its partner organization must enter into a Maintenance Agreement that provides for the ongoing maintenance of the proposed outdoor learning space.

Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $5,170,347, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials. endRecommendationAction Proposed: 1) Define and approve three projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $5,170,347.  2) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials. endBodyBackground: Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District's most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District's capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Figueroa Elementary School and Independence Elementary School along with a project to replace flooring in the gymnasium and provide water intrusion mitigation at Fulton College Preparatory School.Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens' Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 4, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified's ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.Expected Outcomes:Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.Policy Implications: The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified's long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. Budget Impact: The total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $5,170,347 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. Los Angeles Unified is also pursuing possible insurance claims for the Fulton College Preparatory School Gymnasium Flooring and Water Intrusion Mitigation Project. Any approved insurance proceeds will offset or reimburse bond funding, though bond funds will likely still be needed to complete the project.Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.Student Impact: Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 2,060 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.Equity Impact: Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.Issues and Analysis: It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.Attachments:Exhibit A - Projects That Address Critical Replacement and Upgrade NeedsExhibit B - BOC ResolutionExhibit C - BOC PresentationSubmitted:08/21/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

These include an initial donation worth $400,000, which will be comprised of a combination of new bakery equipment and/or monetary support, as well as ongoing funding through an annual donation of $30,000 to support operating costs for the bakery program such as training, certifications, ingredients, etc.  The annual donation will commence with the opening of the bakery program at Dorsey High School and continue for 10 years.3) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials and to execute reasonable instruments for the donations including, but not limited to, a donation agreement.endBodyBackground: The School Upgrade Program (SUP), the current phase of the bond program, develops projects that modernize, build, and upgrade school facilities to improve student health, safety and educational quality.  SUP guides the identification of sites and development of project proposals under categories of need with associated spending targets.  Among the SUP categories of need are School Upgrades and Reconfigurations to Support Wellness, Health, Athletics, Learning, and Efficiency - which includes an allocation to support the implementation of projects with partner funding - as well as Region Priority Projects and Board District Priority Projects.  The Dorsey High School Bakery Classroom & Kitchen Project includes funding from each of these SUP categories of need.In addition, Puratos Bakery - an international company providing products and services to the bakery, patisserie, and chocolate industries - wishes to support a new bakery program at Dorsey High School to prepare students for careers in these baking sectors.  The Puratos Bakery School Foundation has opened 13 bakery schools throughout the world including their first U.S. bakery school at Pennsauken High School in Pennsauken, New Jersey in September 2022. Through the Puratos US Charitable Foundation, an initial donation worth $400,000 will provide new bakery equipment and/or monetary support for the Project, however this donation is not included in the Project budget.  Once the Project is completed and the bakery program commences, Puratos Bakery will also provide ongoing funding with an annual donation of $30,000 to support operating costs such as training, certifications, ingredients, etc. for 10 years.  Finally, Puratos Bakery intends to share curriculum developed at their bakery schools and collaborate with the District on the implementation of the Dorsey High School bakery program including possible guest instructors.  Upon Board approval, District staff will engage the Puratos US Charitable Foundation to secure the donations.Exhibit A provides the scope, schedule and budget for the Project; however, the budget represents only the bond-funded portion.  This Bakery Classroom & Kitchen Project will provide Dorsey High School students with the opportunity to train for careers as future bakers, patisseries and chocolatiers by constructing facilities and installing equipment that is comparable to those in the bakery, patisserie, and chocolate industries.  Dorsey High School is located in Region South and Board District 1 (Sherlett Hendy Newbill).Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens' Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 04, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified's ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.Expected Outcomes:Staff anticipates the Board will adopt this proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve the proposed Project.  Approval will authorize District staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project, accept donations in support of the Project, and execute reasonable instruments for the donations including, but not limited to, a donation agreement.  The Bakery Kitchen & Classroom Project will improve student educational quality and provide skills and career preparation.Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Project in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended for capital improvements and the donation will not be accepted in support of a new bakery program at Dorsey High School.Policy Implications: The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by upgrading school facilities that will provide skills and career preparation for students.Budget Impact: The budget for this proposed Project is $3,645,789 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency, and more specifically from the amount allocated for projects that support partnerships.  The Project budget includes contributions of $1,500,000 earmarked for Region Priority Projects in Region South and $200,000 earmarked for Board District Priority Projects in Board District 1 which will be transferred to funds earmarked for school upgrades and reconfigurations to support wellness, health, athletics, learning, and efficiency.The Project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed Project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The Project budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.Student Impact: Approval of the proposed Project enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to improve facilities to benefit the approximately 860 current and future students attending Dorsey High School.  The new bakery program will serve approximately 130 students with Career Technical Education that provides training, certification, and internships to prepare for job opportunities upon graduation.Equity Impact:Dorsey High School collaborated with the partner, Puratos Bakery, to develop the new baking program with a focus on bread, patisserie, and chocolate for students that may not otherwise have an opportunity to train in these specialized areas of the baking industry.  This Project will enable the specialty baking program to provide students with skills for career pathways such as bakers, pastry chefs, and chocolatiers, including certification to be career-ready.Issues and Analysis: It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Project. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined the proposed Project scope will not sufficiently address the program needs identified, the proposed Project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.Attachments:Exhibit A - Dorsey HS Bakery Classroom & Kitchen Project Exhibit B - BOC ResolutionExhibit C - BOC PresentationSubmitted:08/21/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED BY:______________________________			_____________________________	ALBERTO M.

The budget for the proposed Project is $448,914.2) Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.endBodyBackground: On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified's proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility within eight years through facility modifications and operational means.  A need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access buildings at the School has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student's need for programmatic access. These types of projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed ""rapidly"" with a budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed Project does not meet the parameters of the RAP due to its scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the proposed Project to the Board for approval.The School site spans 13.46 acres and is comprised of a traditional middle school program. The building area is approximately 216,767 square feet and includes eight multi-story permanent buildings and eight single-story permanent buildings. The permanent buildings were constructed between 1929 and 1977. As of the 2024-2025 E-CAR, the school serves approximately 453 students and currently 96 students have been identified as having a disability.The site has been assigned a Category Three accessibility level. To meet the criteria for Category Three, upgrades to one building are required including the reconfiguration of the nurse's office restrooms in the Administration building to provide an accessible restroom and an all-gender restroom, and any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2026 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026.Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens' Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on September 04, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified's ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.Expected Outcomes:Define and approve the Project and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.Board Options and Consequences: Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately implement the proposed Project.  If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the barrier removal project which is required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.Policy Implications: The proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements.Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves.  This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. Budget Impact: The total budget for the proposed Project is $448,914 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.The budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.Student Impact: The proposed Project will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 450 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at this campus.Equity Impact:Facilities staff work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.Issues and Analysis: Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability.  As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities.  This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity's facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible.  While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities.  A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity's programs and activities.  This proposed Project is in alignment with Los Angeles Unified's implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.The School has been assigned a Category Three accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing a more robust scope that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that reconfiguring the nurse's office restrooms in the Administration building to provide an accessible restroom and an all-gender restroom would provide students and staff direct access to the building. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).Attachments:Exhibit A - Student Eligibility by Program at Bret Harte Preparatory Middle SchoolExhibit B - BOC ResolutionExhibit C - BOC PresentationInformatives:NoneSubmitted:08/21/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

Brief Description:
description
(Annual Report of the Los Angeles Unified School District Proposition 28: The Arts and Music in Schools Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act) Recommends approval of the Annual Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Report for 2024-2025. The Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Funding Annual Report is a compliance requirement for each Local Education Agency (LEA) that provides narrative and quantitative details relevant to visual and performing arts base funding and Prop 28 funding, categorical state funds, which serve to supplement visual and performing arts instruction.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the annual Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Annual Report for 2024-2025
 
Body
Background: 
On November 8, 2022, California voters approved Proposition 28: The Arts and Music in Schools (AMS) Funding Guarantee and Accountability Act. The measure required the State to establish a new, ongoing program supporting arts instruction in schools beginning in 2023-24 school year. The funding is allocated to school sites based on student enrollment and academic need and, as authorized by the ballot initiative, school sites have three fiscal years to spend each school year’s allocation of funds they receive.
 
The ballot initiative allocates one percent of kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) portion of the Proposition 98 funding guarantee provided in the prior fiscal year, excluding funding appropriated for the AMS education program. Local educational agencies (LEAs) with 500 or more students are required to ensure that at least 80 percent of AMS funds are used to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education program instruction. The remaining funds must be used for training, supplies, materials, and arts educational partnership programs, with no more than one percent of funds received to be used for an LEA’s administrative expenses.  
 
One of the conditions to receive Proposition 28 funds is that “a local educational agency shall annually submit an annual board- or body- approved report in a manner determined by the Superintendent, that shall be posted on the local educational agency and department’s internet websites and that details the type of arts education programs funded by the program, the number of full-time equivalent teachers, classified personnel, teaching aides, the number of pupils served, and the number of school sites providing arts education programs with those funds.”
 
Los Angeles Unified increased its total Arts budget to $231 million in 2024-2025, inclusive of both the District and our Affiliated Charters. Of that $231 million, $101.5 million came from Proposition 28 funds (including carryover from prior entitlements). Proposition 28 funds are allocated to all LAUSD schools serving K-12 students. In the 2024-2025 school year, these funds were allocated to fund approximately 368.41 teachers, 49.57 teacher assistants, and 22.19 classified positions (excluding affiliated charter staffing). 
 
Proposition 28 stipulates that funds be used to increase funding of arts education programs within school districts. While this may differ school-to-school, the law assesses the overall expenditures and investments at the District level. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Increased Proposition 28 funding will result in expanded student access to dance, music, theatre, visual arts and media arts/film instruction during the school day. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board of Education does not approve this annual report, Proposition 28 funds may be delayed or withheld for the 2025-26 school year.
 
Policy Implications: 
None.
 
Budget Impact: 
For the 2024-2025 school year, Los Angeles Unified and its Affiliated Charters received approximately $72 million in new Proposition 28 funding, in addition to the carryover from the 2023-24 entitlement. Please note that the fiscal year 2025 entitlement was finalized in June. The annual state budget appropriation is subject to change year by year, depending on the overall Proposition 98 funds available each fiscal year. 
 
Student Impact:
By providing additional funds to support arts education, the District anticipates increased student achievement outcomes and enhanced social emotional development.
 
Equity Impact:

The error was a result of a mistake in reporting 1.0 FTE for an elementary itinerant arts teacher instead of .36 FTE. The revised 2023-24 report for Community Magnet Charter School is included with their 2024-25 Annual Report. The revised report continues to meet the requirement to ensure that at least 80 percent of the funds were expended to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education program instruction. Prior to the school submitting the revised report to CDE, it must be presented to the Board for approval. All affiliated charter schools will receive additional oversight and training regarding future reports.Expected Outcomes:Increased Proposition 28 funding will result in expanded student access to dance, music, theatre, visual and media arts across all grade levels.Board Options and Consequences: If the Board of Education does not approve this annual report, Proposition 28 funds may be delayed or withheld for 51 affiliated charter schools in Los Angeles Unified for the 2025-2026 school year.Policy Implications: Due to the error in Community Magnet Charter School's Annual Report Proposition 28: The Arts and Music in Schools submission to the state, all affiliated charter schools will receive additional oversight and training regarding future reports.Budget Impact: For the 2024-2025 school year, Los Angeles Unified Affiliated Charters received approximately $5.5 million in new Proposition 28 funding, in addition to the carryover from the 2023-24 entitlement. The annual state budget appropriation is subject to change year to year, depending on the overall Proposition 98 funds available each fiscal year. Student Impact:By providing additional funds to support arts education, the District anticipates increased student achievement outcomes and enhanced social emotional development.Equity Impact:Component  ScoreScore RationalRecognition       4Proposition 28 actively recognizes and specifies historical inequities to correct by providing additional funding for arts and music education in all K-12 public schools and allocates a greater proportion of the funds to schools serving more economically disadvantaged students.Resource Prioritization       3Proposition 28 prioritizes resources based on student need by allocating a greater portion of funds to schools serving more economically disadvantaged students.Component  ScoreScore RationalResults       4Proposition 28 is likely to result in a narrowing of the opportunity gaps and/or achievement gaps for students by providing greater access to arts and music education and program through increased funding targeted to provide programming to economically disadvantaged students.Total      11Issues and Analysis: Each of the 51 affiliated charter schools must submit their own Proposition 28 Annual report. However, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education must approve the reports.Attachments:Proposition 28: Arts and Music in Schools Funding Annual Report for Charter Schools* To review the 51 affiliated charter school individual plans, please click hereSubmitted:09/04/25 RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

The public had an opportunity to be informed about these proposals and to express itself to the Board of Education. Since that time, representatives for the District and each respective bargaining unit have met and negotiated as required by law. The District and these bargaining units reached tentative agreement on June 16, 2025 (Unit A) and May 27, 2025 (Unit H), respectively, relating to implementation of an Automatic Vehicle Locator system and Shift Differential for sworn employes within the District's Los Angeles School Police Department. Copies of Unit A MOUs and Unit H MOUs are available for public review through the Office of Labor Relations.Expected Outcomes:a) Adoption of the Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) and Shift Differential Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) (Attachment A) with Los Angeles School Police Association (Unit A) b) Adoption of the Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) and Shift Differential Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) (Attachment C) with Los Angeles School Police Management Association (Unit H).Board Options and Consequences: a) If the Board adopts the attached Tentative Agreement on Unit A MOUs with the LASPA, which is a joint recommendation of the bargaining parties, it will be implemented. While any/all Unit A classifications would become eligible to receive a shift differential whenever they would be assigned to a majority evening or overnight shift, under current staffing levels, this proposal would impact 13 Police Officers and 2 Senior Police Officers the 2025-25 school year-15 filled, Full-Time Equivalent (FTEs) positions in total. If the Board does not adopt this agreement, it will not be implemented, and the parties would resume negotiations of the Unit A MOUs.b) If the Board adopts the attached Tentative Agreement on the Unit H MOUs with the LASPMA, which is a joint recommendation of the bargaining parties, it will be implemented. While any/all Unit H classifications would become eligible to receive a shift differential whenever they would be assigned to a majority evening or overnight shift, under current staffing levels, this proposal would impact 3 Lieutenants, 4 Sergeants, and 2 Safety Officer Sergeants for the 2025-25 school year-9 filled, Full-Time Equivalent (FTEs) positions in total.

The leadership of the Union has signed the agreement. This agreement is pending AB 1200 certification and ratification by union membership. b) The Unit H MOUs becomes policy upon adoption by the Board and ratification by LASPMA membership. The leadership of the Union has signed the agreement. This agreement is pending AB 1200 certification and ratification by union membership.Budget Impact: a) The budget impact for Unit A MOUs are detailed in the attached AB 1200 Report (Attachment B). b) The budget impact for the Unit H MOUs is detailed in the attached AB 1200 Report (Attachment D). Student Impact:These Agreements will assist the District in attaining its goals for students by enhancing safety, and proximity dispatching to requests for assistance which will attract and retain the highest quality employees.Issues and Analysis: a) The AVL portion of the Unit A MOUs (Attachment A, pgs. 1-2, 5-6) provides 1 hour of employee training on the AVL system and permits the District to deploy the system to the field to support with the efficient monitoring and dispatching of patrol vehicles. Additional refresher training to assist with the implementation of the AVL system may be provided. The Shift Differential portion of the Unit A MOUs (Attachment A, pgs. 3-5) expands shift differentials to include all Unit A employees working a majority of their regular assignment outside of typical school business hours--5% for working one-half or more of a regular shift between 5pm-12am; 11% for working one-half or more of their regular shift between 12am-7am. Previously, only School Safety Officers (25 total under current staffing levels) received a shift differential under prior Unit A CBA provisions. Approval of these agreements will provide for all employees in Unit A who work these evening/overnight shifts to receive the shift differential in the same fashion as most other classified bargaining units. Under current staffing levels, 15 additional Unit A employees would newly begin receiving these differentials for their evening/overnight work during the 2025-26 school year. In total, approximately 15% of Unit A's 259 employee unit would receive these evening/overnight differentials. b) The AVL portion of the Unit H MOUs (Attachment C, pgs. 1-2, 5-6) provides 1 hour of employee training on and permits the District to deploy the AVL system to the field to support with the efficient monitoring and dispatching of patrol vehicles. Additional refresher training to assist with the implementation of the AVL system may be provided. The Shift Differential portion of the Unit H MOUs (Attachment C, pgs. 3-5) newly provides shift differentials to all Unit H employees working a majority of their regular assignment outside of typical school business hours--5% for working one-half or more of a regular shift between 5pm-12am; 11% for working one-half or more of their regular shift between 12am-7am. Previously, only School Safety Officers in similarly situated Unit A received a shift differential under that unit's CBA provisions and Unit H previously received no such differentials. Approval of these agreements will provide for all employees in Unit H who work these evening/overnight shifts to receive the shift differential in the same fashion as most all other classified bargaining units. Under current staffing levels, 9 Unit H employees would newly begin receiving these differentials for their evening/overnight work during the 2025-26 school year. In total, approximately 17% of Unit H's 53 employee unit would receive these evening/overnight differentials.Attachments:Attachment A - Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) and Shift Differential Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with Los Angeles School Police Association (Unit A)Attachment B - Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) and Shift Differential Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with Los Angeles School Police ManagementAssociation (Unit H).Attachment C - AB 1200 Report - AVL and Shift Differential MOUs with Los Angeles School Police Association (Unit A) and AVL and Shift Differential MOUs with Los Angeles School Police Management Association (Unit H).Submitted:09/04/25RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,			APPROVED & PRESENTED BY:______________________________			_____________________________ALBERTO M.

(Provisional Internship Permits) Recommends approval for 13 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 13 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education, physical education, mathematics, biological science teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such special education, physical education, mathematics, biological science where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a no vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints.  
 
A “No” vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
A “Yes” vote will approve all actions in accordance with Education Codes & Rules of the Personnel Commission.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable
 
Budget Impact: 
Cost Neutral
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable
 
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
All actions affecting classified personnel and apprentice personnel reported herein are in accordance with Section 45123-45125, 45135, and 45240-45318 of the Education Code and with the Rules of the Personnel Commission.

Whereas, The National Child Welfare Workforce Development Month in September 
offers an opportunity to recognize and honor the work of Child Welfare and Attendance 
Counselors, who help our most vulnerable children and their families.

Whereas, Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors conduct assessments to identify 
issues that may impact attendance and barriers to learning, to facilitate linkages to services that meet the needs of the whole child while simultaneously integrating multi-tiered interventions to promote overall wellness of the family, to address absenteeism, truancy and to support students of culturally diverse populations;

Resolved further, That in a climate of escalating xenophobia where immigrant students and families are effectively kidnapped and incarcerated in dehumanizing conditions, enduring unimaginable suffering, the District commits to provide child welfare support by assigning five Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors in each region and considering additional assignments based on need by considering the number of students and proportionate amount of ice activity in each region in a genuine effort to address immigrant students and family’s needs; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District will continue to promote attendance awareness through District websites and social media outlets, informed by the perspective of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors, as they continue to conduct home visits, bring students back to school, and re-engage families to strengthen child welfare in our communities.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or The District) has a responsibility to ensure students are able to meet their life challenges through grade school and beyond;
 
Whereas, In 2023, the California Department of Education (CDE) reported that only 27 percent of high school students in the state attend a school that offers personal finance courses; 
 
Whereas, In 2023, the California State University (CSU) system approved a rate increase 5 percent every year starting academic year 2023-24 and ending academic year 2028-29 for a total increase of 25% - with undergraduate degrees going from $5,742 to $7,682 per year, graduate degrees from $7,176 to $9,604 per year, and PhDs varying in price but increasing by at least $4,000 per the CSU website - thus increasing the need for borrowing rate for students; 
 
Whereas, Unlawful financial practices burden low-income communities the most and trap families with inescapable debt;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities suffer the most from bank deserts, communities with limited or no banking institutions, that pressure their residents to rely on payday lenders or other companies that offer money loans with high-interest rates;
 
Whereas, Studies show that the borrowing amount, annual percentage rate, or rejection of a home loan has been historically tied to systemic racism, also known as redlining, resulting in harsher loan terms for minority communities despite having similar financial outcomes as their non-minority counterparts;
 
Whereas, Traditionally marginalized communities have lower opportunities to establish generational wealth, with Hispanic communities having a median household income of $62,800 and African-American communities holding $52,860 in median household income, below the national median of $74,580 according to a 2022 United States Census Bureau report;

Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District aims to achieve audacious goals for student achievement and wellness with finite resources, including time, funding and demands on personnel; 
 
Whereas, The District is committed to advancing and balancing pillars of the Strategic Plan, including Pillar 3: Engagement and Collaboration through authentic engagement with families, communities, and educational partners and Pillar 4: Operational Effectiveness, encompassing data-driven decision-making and sustainable budgeting; 
 
Whereas, Various resolutions by the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District have called for task forces or committees to solve a problem or advise on an issue of importance to the Board, almost always without a sunsetting date or final task to demonstrate completion;
 
Whereas, At Board direction, District staff prepare, convene and navigate the diverse perspectives of the various task forces and committees on a regular basis, resulting in countless hours of staff time, with little demonstrated evidence of positive impact on student achievement and Board goals; 
 
Whereas, Multiple task forces have been convened to address overlapping topics such as school safety without a consistent process for coordination, and the District currently lacks a consistent structure for sunsetting task forces and advisory committees, resulting in several remaining active indefinitely without formal evaluation or final outcomes;
 
Whereas, Decision-making authority is not always clear, for example the Arts Justice Advisory Committee has been interpreted to exclude District staff as the lead convener, and the Black Student Achievement Plan Steering Committee has spent many hours debating how decisions should be made; and
 
Whereas, To promote efficiency and accountability, it is essential to establish time-bound and outcome-focused parameters for these bodies and a District staff member as the lead who will report back to the board as indicated in the resolves below; now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District commits to the efficient and effective use of staff time, Los Angeles Unified School District resources and student-focused priorities by:
 

Eliminating or consolidating duplicative and/or inactive task forces and committees
Clarifying the outcomes, tasks and decision-making process of each task force and committee, including that these entities consider the cost of program rollout and/or staff positions when making recommendations to the Board
Adding end dates or annual board approval to continue these bodies
 
Resolved further, That any task force, committee, and/or advisory/work group established by Board Resolution that does not have a District lead (District employee) shall identify one within 30 days; 
 
Resolved further, That all task forces and advisory committees established through Board resolution shall be reviewed annually, and automatically sunset after two years unless formally extended through Board action, and shall not be extended beyond a total of three years; 
 
Resolved further, That each task force and committee, led by its designated District sponsor, must annually provide the Board with a report (oral or written) on the effectiveness and efficiency of the taskforce/committee including the impact on District resources and staff time, and progress towards intended outcomes;
 
Resolved further, That the District will present its first update on task force and committee elimination, consolidation, task-refinement and end dates at a Committee of the Whole by the first quarter of 2026; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That at a minimum, this update should consolidate the School Culture Climate and Safety Task Force, and the Safe Schools Task Force, , and that this resolution shall not govern committees and task forces created by the Board President, Superintendent, or labor union contracts.",,,,,,,,

description
Whereas, The United States has observed Latino/a/e Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 since 1988 to commemorate the contributions, heritage, achievements, and cultural influences of Latino Americans in the United States;
 
Whereas, Latine Heritage Month also recognizes the intersectionality and diversity of the U.S. Latine population, incorporating indigenous histories and celebrating the independence days of several Latin American countries including: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua;
 
Whereas, Latinos also include people of African and indigenous descent who are too often ignored when talking about the history, culture, and contributions of Latin American peoples, despite making up about 10% of U.S. Latinos;
 
Whereas, This month-long recognition serves as an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about Latine history, promote cultural awareness and inclusivity, and celebrate diversity both in the present and in our nation’s history;
 
Whereas, U.S. imperialism and military intervention in Latin America, including in countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, and Nicaragua, has led to mass migration of people fleeing civil wars and economic hardship to the United States;
 
Whereas, The U.S. Latine population has grown to become the second largest racial or ethnic group in the United States in the last decade, reaching 62.6 million Latinos as of 2021 and accounting for 19% of all Americans;
 
Whereas, The state of California is home to the largest Latine population in the country, where they comprise 40.3% of the state’s overall population, and almost 50% of the population of the County of Los Angeles;
 
Whereas, Communities like Pico-Union, Boyle Heights, Koreatown, South East Los Angeles, Pacoima, San Fernando, and others are the traditional neighborhoods in Los Angeles of immigrant Latine students and their families;
 
Whereas, Latine students comprise almost 78% of the Los Angeles Unified School District student population, underscoring the importance and relevance of Latine Heritage Month among the District’s students and families;
 
Whereas, Recognizing and celebrating Latine Heritage Month as a District furthers the work of our Strategic Plan to provide culturally relevant, empowering curriculum that inspires students to become leaders and advocates for their communities;
 
Whereas, The District is committed to supporting newcomer students and multilingual learners (MLLs), through the establishment of newcomer programs across the District, including international newcomer academies, that are intended to serve students enrolled in U.S. schools for 3 years or less;
 
Whereas, The District is committed, above and beyond this commemoration, to empowering students through culturally responsive and inclusive learning environments that celebrates the value and diversity of all its students;
 
Whereas, In the current national climate, recognizing and honoring Latine communities is even more critical, as families face intensified attacks on public education and anti-immigrant rhetoric, violent raids, and policies that threaten the safety and full participation of Latino and immigrant students and families;
 
Whereas, Ethnic Studies programs are culturally responsive programs that include the study of Latine history, culture, and contributions, but have come under increasing attack from those championing a sanitized version of American history, threatening the ability of students to access inclusive and empowering curriculum;
 
Whereas, Spanish language instruction plays a critical role in preserving cultural heritage, fostering bilingualism and biliteracy, and supporting students’ academic and social-emotional success, yet is at risk in the face of policy and funding pressures;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes and celebrates that a significant number of Latine students are indigenous, with many speaking indigenous languages reflecting the cultural and linguistic diversity within the Latine community;
 
Whereas, The experiences of Latine students are impacted by their family’s economic status, with low-income Latine students historically facing some of the widest educational disparities; 
 
Whereas, The current political climate has seen an unprecedented and often violent increase in anti-immigrant enforcement actions, policy proposals, and rhetoric that directly impact Latino students, families, and communities, creating fear and barriers to full participation in public education; and
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District remains committed to its status as a sanctuary district, implementing policies and practices that protect immigrant students and families from discrimination, harassment, and enforcement actions on school grounds in addition to providing resources and direct support for those impacted; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognizes and celebrates September 15 through October 15 as Latino Heritage Month; 
 
Resolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will work to promote educational resources on Latine history, culture, and heritage and make them widely available to staff, students, and families online through the Los Angeles Unified School District homepage and social media accounts; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board reaffirms its commitment to fully implement and protect Ethnic Studies curriculum that reflects the histories, struggles, and contributions of Latine communities, recognizing it as a critical component of a well-rounded education for all students; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board affirms that, given the large percentage  of Latine students in LAUSD, Latine history, experiences, and contributions should be integrated and embedded in all areas of the curricula and at all ages, not just during Latine Heritage Month or in Ethnic Studies, and that the District should, therefore, strive to support educators to do so; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board recognizes the importance of Spanish language instruction as both a core academic subject and a cultural bridge for our diverse communities, and commits to protecting and expanding high-quality, culturally affirming Spanish language programs amid current pressures and threats to bilingual education, as well as continued efforts to foster the inclusion of and improve supports for students and families who are primarily speakers of indigenous languages; 
 
Resolved further, That in light of the current political climate and the heightened attacks on Latine and all immigrant students and families, the Board reaffirms its status as a sanctuary district, its unwavering dedication to ensuring that LAUSD remains a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment for every student, regardless of cultural background or immigration status, and to continue advancing policies and practices that protect their rights, dignity, and educational opportunities; 
 
Resolved further, That the Board further reaffirms the need for integrating trauma-informed practices in the curricula and providing mental health support and programs at school sites to support students and their families;
 
Resolved further, That the District acknowledges that ongoing investments in and implementation of LGBTQ+ supports, the Black Student Achievement Plan, and Student Success Centers will impact our Latine students in a positive and powerful way;
 
Resolved further, That the Office of the Superintendent will monitor and update the Board on impacts to learning, student and staff attendance, well-being and school climate, and family engagement that may result from current and future federal actions and identify ways LAUSD can mitigate any barriers, provide additional supports,  and ensure all students receive their constitutional rights to a public education; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That by adoption of this resolution, the Board and Superintendent hereby encourage all students, staff, and families, to commemorate and celebrate the immense historical and cultural contributions that Latine people have made and continue to make here in Los Angeles, California, and the United States particularly in light of the targeted assaults this community faces today.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Whereas, In the State of California, residents aged 16-24 comprise 12% of California’s working population with 72% of young workers identifying as people of color, 64% earning low wages, and half still attending school;
 
Whereas, The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) was signed into law, which ensured young workers’ rights to safe environments and to pursuit educational opportunities, even as states around the nation have passed laws to weaken this regulation since 2022;
 
Whereas, According to the U.S. Labor Department Wage and Hour Division, minors employed in violation of child labor laws increased between 2015 and 2022 over threefold, from 1,012 to 3,876 cases; 
 
Whereas, In 2020, the rate of work-related injuries treated in emergency departments for workers, ages 15-24, was 1.5 times greater than the rate for workers 25 years of age and older; 
 
Whereas, Sexual harassment is highest in industries where young workers are concentrated: according to the Center for American Progress, in 2017, restaurants/food service, hospitality, and retail accounted for nearly 30% of all sexual harassment claims; 
 
Whereas, In 2021, almost half (44.2%) of the 19,000 wage theft claims for unpaid wages filed in California were in the aforementioned industries where young people predominantly work; 
 
Whereas, California has extensive existing regulations surrounding the type of employment allowed for minors, restrictions on hours worked, and requirements for employers of minors; 
 
Whereas, Until recently, there was no regulation in place requiring minors to receive information regarding their rights as active participants in the workforce, specifically their rights as employed minors; 
 
Whereas, This lack of knowledge has made California working youth vulnerable to exploitation, harassment, and harm in the workplace; 
 
Whereas, Therefore, it is essential for young Californians entering the workforce to be thoroughly educated on their rights as workers and to give them the tools to prevent exploitation from their employers; 
 
Whereas, Assembly Bill (AB) 800, authored by Assemblymember Liz Ortega and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2023, enacts a Workplace Readiness Week in California high schools to educate students on their rights as workers, and their explicit rights as employed minors; 
 
Whereas, AB 800 requires that students be provided with information on workers’ rights, including child labor laws, wage and hour protections, workers’ compensation, and the right to organize, all as part of their regular education; 
 
Whereas, The law also requires that this information be provided to students in writing before receiving a worker’s permit; and
 
Whereas, The California Department of Education (CDE) in collaboration with UC Labor Centers and other participating organizations, has created materials to facilitate the implementation of AB 800 in California high schools, including a full curriculum and informational leaflets in English and five of the most commonly spoken languages in California; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That there be a designated AB 800 Coordinator, created by the Los Angeles Unified School District (the District), responsible for managing the implementation of AB 800 in District high schools; That a designee or designees of the Division of Instruction manages the implementation and oversee AB 800 in LAUSD High Schools; 
 
Resolved further, That college and career counselors will receive professional development on AB 800’s requirements so they may plan accordingly when addressing workers’ rights and protections to students;
 
Resolved further, That the Division of Instruction's Office of Career Technical Education (CTE) and Linked Learning should hold two yearly workforce readiness and rights trainings, one per semester, mandatory for CTE educators, Work Experience Educators, the Assistant Principals responsible for coordinating Work Permits, and 12th-grade Social Studies teachers; That the Division of Instruction's Office of Career Technical Education (CTE) and Linked Learning will continue to provide workforce readiness and rights trainings for CTE educators, Work Experience Educators, the school site personnel responsible for coordinating Work Permits, CTE and Linked Learning staff, and 12th-grade Social Studies teachers; 
 
Resolved further, That the District should include workers’ rights and resources on Schoology Groups for Social Studies, CTE, and Work Experience educators, along with Learning Management Systems (LMS) groups dedicated to school site administrators; 
 
Resolved further, That the Division of Instruction should include workers’ rights and protections resources on their Secondary Social Studies website and send out emails to Secondary Social Studies educators about these resources; and be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District should print out poster-sized versions of the UC Labor Center-created “Know Your Rights” document to be placed in all secondary school Counseling Offices.",,,,,,,,

Brief Description:
description
(Unaudited Actuals Report for Fiscal Year 2024-25 and Gann Limit Resolution) Recommends approval of the Unaudited Actuals Report for Fiscal Year 2024-25 and Adoption of the Gann Limit Resolution.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the Unaudited Actuals Report for Fiscal Year 2024-25 (Attachment A) and direct staff to take all necessary actions to submit the Report to the County Superintendent of Schools as required by Education Code and Adopt the Gann Limit Resolution as required under Education Code Section 42132 (Attachment B). 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Education Code Section 42100 requires the District to submit an annual statement of all receipts and expenditures for all funds of the preceding fiscal year to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) on or before September 15th.
 
Under Education Code Section 42132, the District must also adopt a resolution identifying an estimated appropriations limit for the current year and an actual appropriations limit for the preceding year. The so- called “Gann Initiative” places limits on the growth of expenditures for publicly funded programs.
 
Although the Gann Limit calculations are provided as part of the Unaudited Actuals Report, a specific resolution is required by statute.
 
Expected Outcomes:
The District’s statement of revenues and expenditures (Unaudited Actuals) for Fiscal Year 2024-25 shall be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools in compliance with Education Code 42100. The budget beginning balance for the current fiscal year (2025-26) shall be updated based on the Unaudited Actuals report.
 
The adopted Gann Limit Resolution shall be presented to the public.
 
Board Options and Consequences:
Board approval and filing of the Unaudited Actuals Report and the adoption of the Gann Limit Resolution are statutorily mandated. 
 
A “Yes” vote, would allow the District to comply with the requirements of Ed Code by submitting the required report and resolution.
 
A “No” vote, shall cause the District to be non- compliant with the requirements of Ed Code.
 
Policy Implications:
None.
 
Budget Impact:
Fiscal Year 2025-26 carryover balances for schools and offices shall be adjusted based on updated actual ending balances from the prior fiscal year and in accordance with current carryover policies.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Codes 42100 and 42132 ensures that the District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.
 
Equity Impact:
 



Component

   Score

Score Rationale



  Recognition

       4

Unaudited Actuals are an annual statement reporting on the financial activities of the District prior to audit. Revenues and expenditures reported ranges from “not recognizing historical inequities” to “actively recognizing and specifying historical inequities.” While some allocations of resources are district-wide, some investments are allocated using metrics that recognize historical inequities.



 Resource Prioritization

      4

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population to address the unique needs for specific students’ group and provide additional support to accelerate gains in closing learning gaps.



 Results

      4

Resources are allocated to the extent that it would improve student achievement and equity across all student groups in alignment with the District’s Strategic Plan.

     12

 


 
Issues and Analysis:
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the District was able to meet its financial commitments and required ending balances, as set forth in the District’s Budget and Finance Policy. The Unaudited Actuals resulted in a General Fund unassigned balance of $2,011 million, which is $96 million higher than projected in Estimated Actuals. This shall be considered in the Budget for fiscal year 2025-26. 
 
The Fiscal Stabilization Plan will be updated at first interim to account for the $96 million. Additionally, the Unaudited Actuals reflect the Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) original assumptions included in the adopted 2025-26 Budget.  The updated OPEB assumption changes presented at budget adoption on June 24, 2025, will also be reflected at first interim. Additionally, the Classroom Expense Actuals (CEA) form includes manual adjustments beyond the automated adjustments to more accurately reflect the percentage of District classroom expenditures. The District shall continue to monitor spending and explore strategies to maximize revenues and maintain a balanced budget.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Accelerated Charter Elementary) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Accelerated Charter Elementary, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 528 students in grades TK-6 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Accelerated Charter Elementary (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 528 students in grades TK-6 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Accelerated Charter Elementary is a TK-6 school currently serving 512 students on a District site pursuant to a lease agreement at 3914 S. Main St., Los Angeles, CA, 90037 in Board District 5 and Region East. Accelerated Charter Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 25, 2003.  On March 6, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 528 students in grades TK-6. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Accelerated Charter Elementary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Accelerated Charter Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Accelerated Charter Elementary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 122-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista is a TK-8 school currently serving 464 students on two private facilities at 11561 Gateway Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 and 11518 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 in Board District 4 and Region West. Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 7, 2012.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 1,070 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 125-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
ICEF Vista Middle Academy is a 6-8 school currently serving 192 students on a private facility at 5456 McConnell Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90066 in Board District 4 and Region West. ICEF Vista Middle Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 26, 2007.  On September 12, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 500 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year.

Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for ICEF Vista Elementary Academy) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for ICEF Vista Elementary Academy, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 370 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for ICEF Vista Elementary Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 370 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The charter school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 450 to 370 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
ICEF Vista Elementary Academy is a TK-5 school currently serving 266 students on a private facility at 4471 Inglewood Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90066 in Board District 4 and Region West. ICEF Vista Elementary Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on July 8, 2008.  On September 12, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for ICEF Vista Elementary Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, ICEF Vista Elementary Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current ICEF Vista Elementary Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 132, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. is a 9-12 high school currently serving 120 students on a District site at 4120 11th Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90008 in Board District 1 and Region South. CATCH Prep Charter High, Inc. was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 11, 2003.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 600 students in grades 9-12.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Extera Public School No. 2) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Extera Public School No. 2, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 2 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 245 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Extera Public School No. 2 (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 2 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 245 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 432 to 245 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Extera Public School No. 2 is a TK-5 school currently serving 108 students on a District Prop. 39 co-location at 4112 E. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90023 in Board District 2 and Region East. Extera Public School No. 2 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 432 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Extera Public School No. 2 expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August, 20, 2025, Extera Public School No. 2 submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025. 
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Extera Public School No. 2 governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 128-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
Equitas Academy 5 is a TK-4 school currently serving 178 students on a private facility at 1612 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90015 in Board District 5 and Region West. Equitas Academy 5 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for High Tech LA (“Charter School”), a Conversion Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 415 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
High Tech LA is a 9-12 school currently serving 351 students on the Lake Balboa Education Complex at 17111 Victory Blvd., Van Nuys, CA, 91406 in Board District 3 and Region North. High Tech LA was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 11, 2003, as a start-up affiliated charter school. The charter was renewed by the Board of Education on April 8, 2008, as a conversion independent charter school. Most recently, on December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 415 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for High Tech LA expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, High Tech LA submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current High Tech LA governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 129, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
High Tech LA Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 277 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-Location site at 5041 Sunnyslope Avenue, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91423 in Board District 3 and Region North.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Magnolia Science Academy 4 (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 360 students in grades 6-12 in each year of the charter term.

Body
Background: 
Magnolia Science Academy 4 is a 6-12 span school currently serving 124 students on a District campus at 11330 W. Graham Place, Room B-9, Los Angeles, CA, 90064 in Board District 4 and Region West. Magnolia Science Academy 4 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 26, 2008.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Magnolia Science Academy 4 expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Magnolia Science Academy 4 submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Magnolia Science Academy 4 governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 135, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Rise Kohyang Elementary (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 2 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 569 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Rise Kohyang Elementary is a TK-5 elementary school currently serving 302 students on a private facility at 600 S. La Fayette Park Place, Los Angeles, CA, 90057 in Board District 2 and Region East. Rise Kohyang Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on December 5, 2017.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Rise Kohyang Elementary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Rise Kohyang Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Rise Kohyang Elementary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 140-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
Stella Middle Charter Academy is a 5-8 span school currently serving 481 students on a private facility at 4301 West Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90008 in Board District 1 and Region West. Stella Middle Charter Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 11, 2003.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 750 students in grades 5-8.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for STEM Preparatory Elementary (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 370 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.  The school is requesting to decrease its current enrollment capacity from 450 students to 370 students to align with the school’s enrollment trends.  The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  Please see related Board Report No. 143-25/26.

Body
Background: 
STEM Preparatory Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 316 students on a private facility at 1374 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. STEM Preparatory Elementary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for STEM Preparatory Elementary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, STEM Preparatory Elementary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current STEM Preparatory Elementary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 142-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
STEM Preparatory Elementary is a TK-5 school currently serving 316 students on a private facility at 1374 W. 35th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90007 in Board District 1 and Region South. STEM Preparatory Elementary was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on November 7, 2017.
 
On August 21, 2025, the Charter Schools Division commenced processing of STEM Preparatory Elementary’s complete material revision. STEM Preparatory Elementary seeks to revise its current charter, which expires June 30, 2026.  
 
Based on a comprehensive review of the material revision application and supporting documentation, staff has determined that the charter school has met the standards and criteria set forth in Education Code section 47605 (see Ed. Code, §47607(b)) and therefore recommends approval of the material revision of the charter.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, and local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate as a charter school, as amended, for the remainder of the charter term.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval of the material revision of the charter, and instead takes specific action to deny the proposed material revision of the charter, Charter School would continue to operate under the terms of its current charter consistently with the Board’s action and direction. 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.

Body
Background: 
Valley International Preparatory High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 291 students on a private facility at 18827 Roscoe Blvd., Northridge, CA, 91324 in Board District 3 and Region North. Valley International Preparatory High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education December 5, 2017. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Valley International Preparatory High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Valley International Preparatory High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Valley International Preparatory High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 144-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Valor Academy High (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 6 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 480 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Valor Academy High is a 9-12 high school currently serving 507 students on a private facility at 9356 Lemona Avenue, North Hills, CA, 91343 in Board District 6 and Region North. Valor Academy High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 19, 2013.  On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 480 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Valor Academy High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Valor Academy High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Valor Academy High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 145-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues.

If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.

Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Body
Background: 
Wallis Annenberg High is a 9-12 school currently serving 483 students on a District site pursuant to a lease agreement at 4000 S. Main St., Los Angeles, CA, 90037 in Board District 5 and Region East. Wallis Annenberg High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 25, 2003.  On March 6, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 600 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Wallis Annenberg High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Wallis Annenberg High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.

Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in the area of academics (ELPI), located in Board District 1 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 370 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The charter school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 450 to 370 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 245 students on a private facility at 5029 S. Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90037 in Board District 1 and Region South. ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on July 8, 2008.  On September 12, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August, 21, 2025, ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025. 
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current ICEF Innovation Los Angeles Charter governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 131, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Background: 
City Language Immersion Charter is a TK-5 school currently serving 358 students on a private facility at 4001 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90019 in Board District 1 and Region West. City Language Immersion Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 432 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year.

Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for Camino Nuevo High #2) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for Camino Nuevo High #2, a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in academics (ELPI), located in Board District 2 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 500 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Camino Nuevo High #2 (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school with a benchmark in the area of academics (ELPI), located in Board District 2 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve 500 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.

Body
Background: 
Camino Nuevo High #2 is a 9-12 high school currently serving 504 students on a private facility at 3500 W. Temple Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90004 in Board District 2 and Region East. Camino Nuevo High #2 was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on March 19, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 500 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Camino Nuevo High #2 expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, Camino Nuevo High #2 submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Camino Nuevo High #2 governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 123-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.

Body
Background: 
New Los Angeles Charter is a 6-8 school currently serving 320 students on a private facility at 1919 S. Burnside Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90016 in Board District 1 and Region West. New Los Angeles Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 22, 2008.  On October 3, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 360 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Los Angeles Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, New Los Angeles Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.

In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Denial of the Renewal Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 270 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for Ingenium Charter Middle (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region North, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Ingenium Charter Middle is a 6-8 school currently serving 195 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-Location (Sutter Middle School) at 7330 Winnetka Avenue, Winnetka, CA, 91306 in Board District 4 and Region North.  Ingenium Charter Middle was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 12, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 270 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Ingenium Charter Middle expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 20, 2025, Ingenium Charter Middle submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and/or 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current Ingenium Charter Middle governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Ingenium Charter Middle and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607, and/or 47607.2, and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 134-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Ingenium Charter Middle, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language.  
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Matrix for Success Academy is a 9-12 span school currently serving 274 students on private facilities at 1010 E. 34th St., Los Angeles, CA, 90011 and 700 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA, 90017 in Board Districts 5 and 2 and Region East, respectively. Matrix for Success Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 13, 2017.  Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Matrix for Success Academy expires June 30, 2026. Matrix for Success Academy was designated by the State as a Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS) school in July of 2019.
 
On August 21, 2025, Matrix for Success Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.

Due Diligence:
Current for Matrix for Success Academy governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.

A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:

•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and

(The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
 
Paragraph (2) and subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 47607.2 [the “middle” and “low” performing criteria for renewal and grounds for nonrenewal] do not apply to charter schools that are eligible for alternate methods for calculating the state and local indicators pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 52064.5. (Ed. Code, § 47607(c)(7).) These charter schools are designated as Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS).  In determining whether to grant a charter renewal for such a charter school, the chartering authority shall consider, in addition to the charter school's performance on the state and local indicators included in the evaluation rubrics adopted pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 52064.5, the charter school's performance on alternative metrics applicable to the charter school based on the pupil population served.  
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for Matrix for Success Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined closure of Charter School is in the best interest of pupils.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 136, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for Matrix for Success Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the new petition.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Denial of the Renewal Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 388 students in grades 6-8 in each year of the charter term.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal charter petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 5 and Region East, and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles. The school is requesting to reduce enrollment capacity from 504 to 388 students to align with its enrollment projections based on its enrollment trends in the current term.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  is a 6-8 school currently serving 309 students on a private facility at 8001 Santa Fe Avenue, Walnut Park, CA, 90255 in Board District 5 and Region East. PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013. On December 5, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 504 students in grades 6-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles  expires June 30, 2026.
 
On August 21, 2025, PREPA TEC - Los Angeles submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through November 19, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on October 14, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and/or 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Due Diligence:
Current PREPA TEC - Los Angeles governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined, the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the renewal petition due to substantial governance factors (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).); and Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Ed. Code, § 47607(c).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 139-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition.
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for PREPA TEC - Los Angeles, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has chosen to remain with a non-LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) of which it is currently a participating member. Should Charter School subsequently elect to be part of the LAUSD SELPA, any Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Charter School and the District. The Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

(Strengthening Career Technical Education Act (Perkins V) Grant). Recommends ratifying the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins V) grant for the 2025-2026 fiscal year in the amount of $7,141,552.00. The Perkins V grant provides federal funding to enhance and expand Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs, ensuring that students acquire the academic, technical, and employability skills necessary for success in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand careers. The grant emphasizes equity and access by modernizing CTE programs to serve all students across middle and high schools. Perkins V also supports strong partnerships among schools, industry, and postsecondary institutions to align education with workforce needs, while promoting innovation, program improvement, and accountability. Currently, 149 schools access CTE services through Perkins funding. Annual ratification by the Board is required to authorize the distribution of these funds and ensure the continued delivery of CTE services to participating schools.

end
 
Body
Background: 
This annual federal reimbursement entitlement grant provides LAUSD with funds to strengthen and enhance the Career Technical Education (CTE) program. Per the California Department of Education (CDE). Students in CTE pathways have higher attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and increased post-secondary enrollment rates.
 
The schools receiving the grant, applied for the grant and were selected based on their application responses and evidence of meeting the essential elements of high quality [1) student-centered delivery of services, 2) equity, and access, 3) skilled instruction and educational leadership, 6) career exploration and student support, 7) appropriate use of data and continuous improvement, 8) cross-system alignment, 9) intentional recruitment and marketing, 10) sustained investments and funding through mutual agreements, and 11) strong partnerships with industry] CTE programs.
 
Grant funds will support CTE teachers from 149 schools across all regions in professional development targeting special populations including emergent bilingual students, special needs students, and economically disadvantaged students.
 
The grant funds are used to purchase equipment and materials for CTE pathways to ensure pathways have industry-standard equipment.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
•                     Increase the number of students
o                     Acquiring technical and career-ready skills through growing CTE pathways
o                     Earning industry-recognized certifications to gain employability skills

o                     Completing CTE pathways and transitioning to post-secondary institutions to advance their skills for careers of their choice
o                     Provide pathways with industry-standard equipment and materials
•                     Provide pathways with industry-standard equipment and materials
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If ratified, Career and Technical Education (CTE) students will have access to allowable purchases funded through the Perkins V grant. If not ratified, the District and its CTE students will forfeit $7,141,552.00 in grant funding, resulting in the discontinuation of CTE programs within the District.
 
Policy Implications: 
None
 
Budget Impact: 
None. There are no match requirements for this grant.
 
Student Impact:
•                     Career exploration and guidance opportunities for students

(Adoption of Textbooks for Advanced Placement History/Social Science Courses)  Recommends adoption of Textbooks for Advanced Placement History/Social Science Courses and approval of the updated instructional materials for nine Advanced Placement History/Social Science courses and authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to negotiate and execute five-year textbook purchase agreements, not to exceed $6.6 million, within existing program budgets.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Approve the adoption of instructional materials outlined for use in the nine (9) Advanced Placement (AP) History/Social Science courses listed in Attachment A; and
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer to negotiate and execute five-year textbook purchase agreements, in a not-to-exceed amount of $6.6 million, funded within existing program budgets, will be presented to the Board of Education (Board) for ratification, likely in Spring 2026.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The California State Board of Education (SBE) reviews and adopts instructional materials for kindergarten through grade eight. Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, school districts may also select instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, including for grades nine through twelve, provided the materials align with State standards and are reviewed by a majority of classroom teachers in the relevant subject area or grade level.
 
Los Angeles Unified’s current Advanced Placement (AP) History textbooks include two courses adopted in Fall 2017 and six courses adopted in Fall 2018, with copyright dates ranging from 2015 to 2018. Since those adoptions, the College Board has revised and updated several AP courses and corresponding exams. One course-AP Comparative Government-does not currently have an adopted textbook.
 
To address these needs, Library & Textbook Support solicited submissions from multiple publishers for the courses listed in Attachment A. Evaluation committees, composed of teachers currently teaching the respective AP courses, conducted a rigorous review of the submitted materials. Collectively, these educators represent more than 673 years of teaching experience across all four Regions of the District. The committees applied established criteria, including alignment with College Board Course and Exam Descriptions, consistency with SBE-adopted content standards, program organization, assessment, universal access, and instructional planning with teacher support. Based on this review, the committees identified and recommended the instructional materials that best meet the learning needs of Los Angeles Unified students.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Board adoption of the instructional materials recommended for use in the District will result in students having textbooks aligned with the State standards and/or Advanced Placement requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the recommended instructional materials will:
•                     Ensure that instructional content for AP History/Social Science courses aligns with the current College Board frameworks and expectations.
•                     Provide students with high-quality, accurate, and culturally responsive resources that support rigorous AP coursework.
•                     Enhance student preparedness and performance on AP exams, improving opportunities for college credit and advanced standing.
•                     Support teachers with updated, standards-aligned instructional tools and professional learning materials.
 
If the Board of Education does not adopt the recommended instructional materials, students will be required to continue using the currently adopted textbooks-or, in some cases, have no adopted textbooks at all, depending on the course. This would result in students relying on outdated resources that are not aligned with the current College Board Advanced Placement (AP) course frameworks and exams. Such misalignment could place students at a disadvantage in both AP coursework and exam readiness, potentially impacting their academic performance and college credit opportunities.
 
Policy Implications: 
The policy of targeting state funding to implement adoptions is consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board of Education.
 
Budget Impact: 
General Fund and Lottery apportionment from the State are the budgeting expenditures for textbooks, 4000 - object code. The aggregate not-to-exceed cost of the proposed textbook adoption for instructional materials to support nine courses is $6.6 million, covering five years, with the majority in year one due to the purchase of non-consumable hardcover textbooks. This adoption will be accommodated within existing program budgets.
 
Student Impact:
Updated Advanced Placement textbooks are designed to align with the most current Advanced Placement curriculum and exam format, ensuring our students are prepared for the Advanced Placement exams, which take place every Spring. The availability of these Advanced Placement textbooks underscores our commitment to equitable access to superior educational resources, regardless of students' individual circumstances or available resources.

Score Rationale



Recognition

      3

Although the Advanced Placement (AP) textbooks are published for a national audience rather than specifically for California, publishers have made notable progress in incorporating authentic voices and addressing historical inequities within their content. To further advance educational equity, the District will continue to supplement adopted textbooks with culturally relevant and responsive instructional materials developed by the District and its educational partners. These supplemental resources will help ensure that instruction not only aligns with College Board frameworks but also reflects the diverse histories, perspectives, and experiences of Los Angeles Unified students and communities.



Resource Prioritization

      1

The proposed textbooks will be issued to every student enrolled in the appropriate course, regardless of need. In order to meet Williams Sufficiency requirements, all students, regardless of need, are entitled to a textbook appropriate for their course. These textbooks comply with Education Code requirements.



Results

      3

Providing all students with access to quality Advanced Placement textbooks ensures that they have access to the same high-level educational resources, regardless of their school's location or funding. The recommended books have the content and the resources to close achievement gaps when implemented in concert with culturally responsive pedagogy.

Brief Description:
(Adopt Resolution Certifying Los Angeles Unified School District’s Compliance with California Education Code § 8973) Recommends adoption of a Board Resolution certifying that Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD, Los Angeles Unified, or District) extended-day kindergarten program meets the statutory criteria in California Education Code § 8973 (EC 8973).
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached Board of Education resolution (Exhibit A) declaring LAUSD compliance with California Education Code Section 8973 requirements.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Los Angeles Unified secured $4,459,128 through Office of the Public School Construction’s (OPSC) California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program (Grant) to supplement funding for the Amestoy Elementary School Classroom Replacement Project for the construction of three transitional kindergarten classrooms and three full-day kindergarten classrooms (Project). As a condition of this funding, LAUSD must submit a Board Resolution affirming compliance with Education Code § 8973, which allows kindergarten within an early primary program to exceed four hours (exclusive of recesses) provided the day does not exceed the length of the primary grade day and the program offers ample opportunities for both active and quiet, developmentally appropriate instruction. While LAUSD currently operates an extended-day kindergarten program that meets these criteria, the required Board Resolution certifying compliance has not yet been adopted.
 
Transitional Kindergarten (TK) is part of a two-year kindergarten program. Students are placed in TK the first year and kindergarten in the second year based on age level eligibility. This program is developmentally appropriate, and standards align instruction, while providing ample opportunities for active and quiet activities as necessary.
end
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon adoption of the attached resolution, the District will be compliant with Education Code Section 8973. In addition, staff will be able to certify that the declaration requirement of the Grant has been met.
end
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the proposed resolution is not approved, the District will not be compliant with EC section 8973, and the District will be obligated to return the $4,459,128 in State grant funds already received for the Project, plus interest. The District would then need to use local bond funds to cover the loss of State funds and would become ineligible to receive other State grants for extended-day kindergarten facilities.
end
 
Policy Implications: 
Staff’s proposal also aligns with Pillar 2, Priority A (Joy and Wellness: Welcoming Learning Environments) and Pillar 4, Priority B (Operational Effectiveness: Modernizing Infrastructure) of LAUSD’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan by facilitating student access to safe and healthy learning environments.
..end
 
Budget Impact: 
The Project is funded by the Grant and Bond Program funds earmarked for major modernizations, upgrades, and reconfigurations to school campuses. This action will not affect the Board-approved budget for the Project, but failure to pass the proposed resolution would necessitate replacement of the State Grant funds with Bond Program funds. The action does not have an impact on General Funds.
end
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this action will also allow LAUSD to comply with the requirements of the Grant, thus enabling the District to retain existing state funding and possibly receive future funding to construct new classrooms and modernize existing facilities, which will facilitate student access to safe and healthy learning environments.
end
 
Equity Impact: 
EC section 8973 allows for extended-day kindergarten programs, which can exceed the standard four-hour day, provided the district's governing board declares the extended day does not exceed the length of the primary school day and the program integrates ample time for both active and quiet activities.
end
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Adopting the resolution will bring the District into compliance with EC section 8973 for extended-day kindergarten, while supporting the implementation of the Project. It will not alter the Board-approved Project scope or alter how the District implements extended-day kindergarten.

Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Division within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of  award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  Purchase Orders; District Card Transactions; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders; and approve Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract as listed in Attachment “B.”
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts, furnishing the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  Postponement of actions presented for approval in Attachment “B” will delay contract award or delivery dates. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board approved budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Request for Approval of Procurement Actions not under delegated authority listed in Attachment “B” includes:
 
•                     Professional Service Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and 
 
•                     Goods and General Services Contracts (exceeding $250,000):  New Contracts; and Piggyback Contract
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See Attachment C for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Team, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Facilities Contracts Actions) Recommends the ratification of Procurement Services Division contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts; emergency contract amendment and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including professional services contracts; architectural and engineering contracts; and environmental laboratory services contracts.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the Procurement Services Division (PSD) contract actions taken by Facilities Contracts under delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including: award of advertised construction contracts; award of job order contracts; award of job order contract amendments; approval of change orders; completion of contracts; award of informal contracts; assignment and assumption of rights and delegation of duties; award of architectural and engineering contracts; extra services / amendments for architectural and engineering contracts and approved proposed contracts in Attachment B including fire life safety training and video creation services and materials testing and special inspection services contracts.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Facilities Contracts staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of projects approved by the Board and contained in the FSD Strategic Execution Plan (SEP), and for the maintenance and operation of District facilities in accordance with District policies and Board-delegated authority. As described in the November 12, 2013 Board Report #048-13/14 Informative, detailed information is provided on the Facilities Services website.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow services provided by these contracts to proceed in support of FSD projects, District policies and goals, and the Board-approved FSD-SEP.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in the immediate discontinuance of services. While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it will likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor. District costs will likely increase as fewer contractors compete for future procurements.
 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Facilities Contracts (Board Report #444-17/18), which the Board exercised on May 08, 2018.
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board. Unless indicated otherwise, all contract actions are Bond funded.
 
Student Impact:
The contract actions will help ensure that the students are provided with safe and healthy environments, and up to-date facilities that promote learning.
 
Equity Impact:
Not Applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the attached resolution (Attachment A) regarding the Capital Facilities Fund Annual Accounting Report (Attachment B) in accordance with Government Code Sections 66000 et esq.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Education Code Section 17620 allows school districts to assess fees on residential and commercial construction within their respective boundaries when a reasonable relationship exists between the need for new or reconstructed school facilities and resident, commercial and industrial development.  These fees are paid by property owners and developers to school districts to mitigate the impact created by new development within a school district’s boundaries on the school facilities.
 
School impact fees may be used only for the (a) construction and reconstruction of school facilities, (b) costs associated with conducting any study, finding, needs analysis or determination required as part of the process to adopt the school impact fees, (c) costs for administering the fee, and (d) costs associated with conducting the meeting(s) required for levying a fee. Education Code section 17620 clarifies that the “construction or reconstruction of school facilities” does not  encompass: (a) regular maintenance or routine repair of school buildings and facilities, (b) the inspection, sampling, analysis, encapsulation, or removal of asbestos-containing materials except where incidental to school facilities construction or reconstruction, or (c) or deferred maintenance.
 
Per policy, once the costs related to administering the school impact fees and fulfilling the required analysis and reporting duties have been subtracted, the adjusted school impact fees shall be used on permissible projects that have already been approved by the Board of Education. These projects and associated funding shall be incorporated in the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) unless the project’s budget does not include bond funding.
 
Attachment C lists the FY25 expenditures for construction and reconstruction of school facilities expenditures on permissible projects that have been approved by the Board and incorporated into the Facilities SEP.
 
Per Government Code section 66000 et seq., a school district that collects school impact fees is obliged to provide an annual financial report of fees collected, including starting and ending balances, collected fee amounts, and interest earned. 
This report must be submitted within 180 days after the conclusion of each fiscal year (refer to attachments B and C).
 
Expected Outcomes:
The District shall be in compliance with Government Code Sections 66000 et seq. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board adopts the resolution on the annual accounting report, the District will comply with Government Code Sections 66000 et seq.  
 
If the Board does not adopt the resolution, the District will be out of compliance, which could affect its ability to assess school impact fees or require refunds of unspent school impact fee proceeds. 
 
Policy Implications: 
In accordance with the School Impact Fees Policy, the Chief Financial Officer is presenting the annual accounting report of the Capital Facilities Fund's beginning and ending balances, fees collected, interest and other income received, expenditures by project and refunds made for fiscal year 2025. 
 
Budget Impact: 
None
 
Student Impact:
School impact fees assessed upon new residential, commercial or industrial development projects located within District boundaries are used to provide funds for construction and reconstruction of school facilities to accommodate students generated from new development projects. School impact fees are only allocated to permissible projects that have already been approved by the Board. These projects are incorporated into the Facilities SEP unless the project’s budget does not include local bond funding. Projects funded in full or partially by School Impact Fee revenue, may provide additional capacity to accommodate an increase in students in a certain neighborhood(s) and/or provide reconstructed/modernized school facilities to ensure schools are safe and can be occupied, and that the District can maintain existing facilities levels of service for students, and has facilities in place to accommodate additional students from residential developments.

Approval of Career Technical Education Facilities Program Grant Applications
Facilities Services Division
end
 
description
Brief Description:
(Approval of Career Technical Education Facilities Program Grant Applications) Recommends approval to submit grant applications for State of California Department of Education’s Career Technical Education Facilities Program (CTEFP) Seventh Funding Cycle (Cycle 7). These are grant applications for previously Board of Education (Board) approved projects. For the four previously approved projects, the proposed applications will allow Los Angeles Unified (District) to seek additional State funding support.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve grant applications for submission in Cycle 7 of California’s CTEFP for the four Career Technical Education (CTE) programs described in Attachment A, and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments associated with the grant applications for CTEFP. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
CTEFP provides state funding to qualifying local educational agencies (LEAs) for the construction of new CTE facilities, modernization or reconfiguration of existing CTE facilities, and/or the purchase of CTE equipment with an average useful life expectancy of at least 10 years. Maximum CTEFP grants are $1.5 million for modernization projects and $3 million for new-construction projects. The CTEFP was enacted after public approval of Proposition 1D in November 2006. Current funding for the program comes from Proposition 2, a state bond measure approved by the public in November 2024 that earmarked $600 million to address the need for CTE facilities. 
 
District has identified up to four potential CTEFP applications for submission during the current Cycle 7. In accordance with CTEFP requirements, applications must be approved by the LEA’s governing board. This action will satisfy that requirement and allow the District to apply for up to $10,500,000 in state funding.
 
The seventh funding cycle for CTEFP is currently underway, and applications for this cycle are due at the California Department of Education by December 1, 2025.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will approve up to four grant applications (Attachment A), which will support the construction of new facilities, the modernization or reconfiguration of existing facilities, and/or the purchase of new equipment for CTE courses at LAUSD schools.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
If the Board approves, staff will apply for up to $10,500,000 in CTEFP funding. If the Board does not approve, the District will lose the opportunity to pursue CTEFP grant funding during the current funding cycle.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action will not change current LAUSD policy. 
 
Budget Impact: 
Participation in CTEFP provides a 50% state match for eligible costs, up to $1.5 million for each modernization/reconfiguration project and up to $3 million for each new-construction project.  The Board has already approved facility construction and equipment acquisition for the four projects named in Attachment A, with all project expenses to be paid from local bond funds.  If the Board approves the grant applications for these projects and the applications are funded, local bond funds previously allocated to these projects will become available for other projects.  This action will not affect the General Fund.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of this action will allow staff to pursue grant funds for CTE projects that enhance student learning experience at comprehensive high schools by providing new and upgraded classrooms, workrooms, laboratories, studios, and equipment.  
 
Equity Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the proposed action will enable the District to submit four applications for up to $10,500,000 in state funding that would partly replace local bond funding for projects that have been previously approved by the Board.  If grant monies are not awarded, previously allocated bond funds will be used to complete these Board-approved projects.
Approval of this action does not guarantee that the District will secure CTEFP funding, but merely fulfills a submission requirement that must be met for the applications to be reviewed and scored by the California Department of Education.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 30 Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 30 critical school facility projects to replace and upgrade essential building and site systems, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $6,403,253, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of necessary equipment and materials. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 30 projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $6,403,253.  
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications, and the purchase of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Bravo Medical Magnet High School and Van Deene Elementary School along with 28 projects to provide new secure entry systems at various schools.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve 30 projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. Moreover, the proposed secure entrance projects support the Protecting Our Students and School
Sites Board Resolution.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 30 proposed Projects is $6,403,253 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. 
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 25,850 current and future students attending these 30 schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact: 
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects. As necessary, the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to ensure compliance. If, through the planning process, it is determined the proposed project scopes will not sufficiently address the critical needs identified, the project scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board of Education will define and approve the proposed Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Projects. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended and access to nature-based green space will remain limited.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the proposed Projects is $4,198,776. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each budget for the proposed Projects was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about their proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual budgets for the proposed Projects will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known and/or unforeseen conditions arise, and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each of the proposed Projects.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning to benefit approximately 440 current and future students.
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor classrooms will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
Equity Impact:
The proposed Projects were identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with Regions and school site administrators. Sites were selected based upon each center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Projects’ proposals in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Projects’ scopes will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Projects’ scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve six accessibility enhancement projects at Calahan ES, Del Amo ES, Figueroa ES, Frost MS, Gaspar de Portola Charter MS, and Vintage Math/Science/Technology Magnet ES as described in Exhibit A, to support the implementation of the Board of Education (Board) approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan (Transition Plan) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for the six proposed projects is $55,059,901.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board approved the Transition Plan under the ADA to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements. The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
Under the Transition Plan, each school is assigned to one of three levels of accessibility (Category One, Two, or Three) based on assessments of more than two dozen criteria including school programs, matriculation options, feeder pattern, geographic location, known (or anticipated/matriculating) population of students with disabilities or parents/guardians with disabilities, type of instructional model, and public input. The assigned category reflects the level of accessibility the site needs to meet. Schools that do not yet meet the criteria for their assigned category will undergo accessibility improvements and are prioritized for project development based on the criteria mentioned above. The three categories of accessibility are as follows: 
 
₋                     Category One: These are “key” schools and will have the highest level of access, generally in accordance with applicable physical accessibility standards. Category 1A will provide “full accessibility” for the schools that were built to new construction standards, while Category 1B will provide “high accessibility” for schools that have been altered with some limited exceptions.
 
₋                     Category Two: These will be “program-accessible” schools. The core spaces and features of these schools would be made accessible; in addition, program accessibility would be provided to all programs and activities at the school. 
 
₋                     Category Three: These schools will have “core access,” which means that the core spaces (certain common spaces) would be made accessible, to ensure a basic level of access to the building. These include, for example, parking, the main entrance and main office, assembly areas, and some restrooms.
 
The six school sites for which an accessibility enhancement project is being proposed do not yet meet their assigned category/level of accessibility and thus require facilities improvements. The scope, schedule, and budget for each proposed project reflects the existing known conditions at each school site and the improvements necessary to meet each school’s assigned category of accessibility. The conditions of significance include acreage, topography, square footage, existence of multi-story buildings, age of buildings, as well as the number of schools, programs, features, and activities at a school site. 
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit C. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit D. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve six accessibility enhancement projects as detailed in Exhibit A and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately begin designing the proposed projects at six school sites.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the six proposed accessibility enhancement projects, which are necessary to achieve program accessibility as outlined in the Transition Plan and are required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal furthers the implementation of the Transition Plan. As outlined in the Transition Plan, at Category One, Two, and Three schools, an appropriate number of classrooms will be identified to serve as accessible learning spaces, some of which may require facility improvements to meet the criteria for their assigned accessibility category. Additionally, the proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements at schools.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves. This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget, as currently estimated, for the six proposed projects is $55,059,901. The proposed projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
The six proposed projects will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 4,870 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at each campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability. As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible. While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities. These proposed projects are in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve 18 Board District Priority and Region Priority Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of 18 Board District Priority and Region Priority projects, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $1,101,388, and authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects including executing instruments, budget modifications and procurement of necessary equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve 18 Board District Priority (BDP) and Region Priority (RP) projects, as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total budget for these proposed projects is $1,101,388.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all instruments necessary, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed projects, including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on November 6, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the schools and their students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the 18 proposed projects is $1,101,388. Sixteen projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Two projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 9,500 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

description 
Brief Description: 
(Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School) Recommends approval of dedication of corner ramp easement to the City of Los Angeles. Pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Los Angeles Unified School District (“District”) and Porter Ranch Development Company, the District is contractually obligated to meet the condition of dedicating the corner cut ramp easement at the intersection of Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue to the City of Los Angeles (“City”) to use as a public right-of-way and to finalize a new parcel map where Porter Ranch Community School was constructed.  
end
 
Recommendation 
Action Proposed:  
Authorize: (1) the dedication of a corner ramp easement to the City by adopting a Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School (Exhibit D) with a vote of at least two-thirds of its members; and (2) the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Final Parcel Map and all reasonable instruments associated with the easement.
 
Property:                                                               Portion of Porter Ranch Community School
                                                                                    12450 Mason Avenue
Porter Ranch, CA 91326
(See Exhibits A, B, and C)
 
Purpose:                                                               Right-of-way public ramp
 
Grantee:                                                               City of Los Angeles
 
Consideration:                                                               None
 
Date of Public Hearing:                     December 16, 2025                     
 
Easement to be Dedicated:                      A 20-foot radius property line return at the intersection with Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue
end
 
Body 
Background:  
​​​In 2009, the District and Porter Ranch Development Company (“Seller”) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“Agreement”) for a parcel of land on which Porter Ranch Community School was constructed and is legally described in Exhibit A. As a condition of the Agreement and in compliance with the California Subdivision Map Act, the Seller was required to complete the recordation of a Final Parcel Map to formally map the property, with a $50,000 escrow holdback to be released to the Seller upon recordation of the map.
 
In 2014 the City’s Planning Department approved the Preliminary Parcel Map AA-2014-1367, and in 2022, the proposed Final Parcel Map was formally submitted to the City’s Land Development Division for review. The proposed map underwent multiple rounds of rigorous technical and regulatory review, involving coordination with the Seller, City’s Planning Department, City’s Bureau of Engineering, and the District. Following this extensive review process, the Final Parcel Map received official approval from the Land Development Division on May 19, 2025 (Exhibit B). As a condition of the City-approved Final Parcel Map, the District is required to dedicate a corner cut ramp easement at the intersection of Sesnon Boulevard and Mason Avenue to the City to use for public access as a right-of-way.   
 
California Education Code sections 17556 through 17561 specify that a Notice of Adoption of Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Easements include a time not less than 10 days after adoption of the Resolution to hold a public hearing by the Board. The adopted Resolution must be posted in three public places within the District’s boundaries no less than 10 days before the date of the public hearing and be published no less five days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the District’s boundaries.  
​
Porter Ranch Community School is located within the boundaries of Region North, and Board District 3 (Scott Schmerelson).   
 
Expected Outcomes: 
Adopt the Resolution of Intention to Dedicate Corner Ramp Easement at Porter Ranch Community School and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to execute the Final Parcel Map and all reasonable instruments associated with the easement.
 
Board Options and Consequences:  
If approved, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will proceed with the necessary steps to dedicate this corner ramp easement to the City and fulfill the District’s obligations under the Agreement and City-approved Final Parcel Map.  After the dedication, the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) will execute the Final Parcel Map and fulfill the District’s obligation under the Agreement.  After executing the Final Parcel Map, the proposed action will ensure the following: 
 
Legal Clarity: Transforms the parcel's legal description from a complex metes-and bounds narrative into a standardized, formal lot description, which will streamline real estate transactions and internal records. 
 
Survey Accuracy and Monumentation: Establishes a permanent, surveyed record of the property’s boundaries, which will ensure accuracy and public transparency. 
 
Formalization of Infrastructure: Solidifies the boundary of existing street improvements and the school footprint, including necessary dedications. 
 
Minimal Impact to District Property: The parcel adjustment results in a minor loss of approximately 55 square feet at the street corner, an area already encumbered by an ADA access ramp that is part of the Mason Ave. and Sesnon Blvd. public improvements. 
 
Recordation of the City-approved Final Parcel Map is not only a legal and procedural requirement, but also offers long-term benefits for the District in terms of clarity, compliance, and infrastructure integration.
 
If the Board does not approve the proposed action, the City cannot proceed with the required recordation of a Final Parcel Map, which will result in the legal boundaries of the school property not being finalized to match the as-built condition. The District will fail to meet its contractual obligation, which is likely to result in unnecessary litigation and related expenses.
 
Policy Implications:  
There is no change to District policy. 
 
Budget Impact:  
There is no budget impact.
 
Student Impact:  
​​​N/A​​ 
 
Equity Impact:  
N/A
 
Issues and Analysis:                       
The 2009 Purchase and Sale Agreement between the District and the Porter Ranch Development Company requires that a new parcel map be recorded as part of the purchase conditions.  Porter Ranch Development Company has recently received approval from the City to finalize this newly created parcel map.  
 
Failure to dedicate the corner ramp easement to the City will prohibit the required recordation of a Final Parcel Map, which will result in the legal boundaries of the school property not being finalized to match the as-built condition, and will likely expose the District to legal action.

(Provisional Internship Permit) Recommends approval of 14 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 14 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education, deaf and hard of hearing, physical education, english, biological science, chemistry, social science and health science teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
There is no impact on the District’s budget.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education, deaf and hard of hearing, physical education, english, biological science, chemistry, social science and health science teachers where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Consideration of Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District
Facilities Services Division
end
 
description
Brief Description:
(Consideration of Street Lighting Maintenance Assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District) Recommends authorization of the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to cast the Proposition 218 ballot(s) in support of the street lighting maintenance assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District (Lighting District) within the City of Los Angeles (City) and execute any other reasonable instruments on behalf of Los Angeles Unified in an amount not to exceed $14,710.41 annually (not including annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases). 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee to cast the Proposition 218 ballot(s) in support of the street lighting maintenance assessment for the Lighting District within the City and execute any other reasonable instruments on behalf of Los Angeles Unified in an amount not to exceed $14,710.41 for the first year the Lighting District is in operation, and thereafter the annually adjusted amount inclusive of the Lighting District’s authorized CPI (or similar) increases for subsequent years until the Lighting District expires or is modified. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
The City Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street Lighting is proposing a street lighting maintenance assessment for the Lighting District to add, maintain, and operate 75 new streetlights along Wilshire Boulevard, 7th Street, Burlington Avenue, Little Street, Union Avenue, Valencia Avenue, and Ingraham Street in Los Angeles. Of these, 59 streetlights would be installed along the perimeter of John H. Liechty Middle School and Esperanza Elementary School (Schools), as identified in Exhibit A. The Lighting District will need to submit ballots to property owners to vote on the assessment and to install the additional streetlights. The Lighting District provides servicing, installation, maintenance, and operation of street lighting. The cost for services includes but is not limited to electricity, lamps, fixtures, poles, wires, repair crews, and other items necessary to operate streetlights in the City. The additional lighting will further enhance safety measures and support safety passages. 
 
Los Angeles Unified currently pays $5,953.71 annually for 27 existing streetlights in this area. If approved and implemented, the annual amount for the special assessment projected by the Lighting District for the School would increase to $14,710.41 for the first year the lighting district is in operation, and thereafter the annually adjusted amount inclusive of the district’s authorized CPI (or similar) increases for subsequent years until the lighting district expires or is modified. This adjustment reflects several key factors: the existing assessment amounts have not been updated for inflation since 1997 due to Prop 218, which froze rates for over 25 years, and the methodology has changed from calculating rates based on property frontage to acreage, resulting in larger parcels incurring higher assessments. Additionally, the inclusion of street lighting, which requires more poles with closer spacing, adds a significant layer of maintenance costs, further contributing to the adjusted rates. 
 
The Lighting District is located in Region East, Board District 2 (Rocio Rivas).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the action will authorize Staff to execute the ballot in support of the proposed lighting assessment provided by the Lighting District and pay the annual assessment for the Lighting District. The increased lighting will help further enhance safe passages to and from school for students attending the School.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “Yes” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a yes vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. 
 
A “No” vote by the Board will authorize Staff to record a no vote on the Proposition 218 ballot for the Lighting District. This may result in the Lighting District failing to obtain a majority affirmative vote of the property owners in the Lighting District. However, if the Lighting District does secure the required support, Los Angeles Unified would still be obligated to pay the cost associated with the special assessments.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 3 Engagement and Collaboration Leading for Impact by growing and leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations. Moreover, it supports the District’s Every School Safe: A Blueprint for Safety.
 
Budget Impact: 
The projected annual amount for the assessment of Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District in 2026 would be increased from $5,953.71 to $14,710.41  and subject to increases based on the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District budget annually thereafter. Annual assessment for the Liechty and Esperanza Schools Lighting District will be provided by the General Fund, Program Code 15190. This is a cost increase, but according to the projections from the Eco-Sustainability Office the program has adequate funding to support this assessment in the current fiscal year and the following fiscal year. The assessment is an ongoing annual cost and does not have a sunset date.
 
Student Impact:
Improve safety measures and support safe passages around the school perimeter and surrounding neighborhood.
 
Equity Impact:
A lighting district is a geographically defined area within the City, in which services, maintenance, and operations are paid for through a special assessment, which is charged to all members within the district in order to equitably distribute the benefits received and the costs incurred to provide the agreed-upon services, activities, and operations.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Article 13 D (Proposition 218) of the State Constitution requires that a parcel’s assessment may not exceed the reasonable cost for the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel. Article 13 D provides that only special benefits are assessable, and the City must separate the general benefits from the special benefits. It also requires that publicly owned properties, which benefit from the improvements, be assessed.
The Bureau of Street Lighting is in the process of creating a Citywide Lighting District, which will require a new Engineer’s Report and an updated methodology for calculating street lighting maintenance assessment rates. Each parcel-including all LAUSD properties-will be evaluated to determine the proportionate special benefit conferred to each property. The proposed Citywide Lighting District and new Engineer’s Report will require approval by the Mayor’s Office and City Council, to establish the new District within the next two-three years. Currently, each parcel’s assessment is calculated in accordance with the Land Use Methodology outlined in the Street Lighting Engineer’s Report. Assessments are primarily based on the parcel’s land use, size (using a table of size ranges rather than a simple per-square-foot calculation), and the equipment type of the lighting system. Additional consideration is given for any benefit-qualifying factors, such as parcel shape and partial lighting. In accordance with City assessment standards, LAUSD will pay no more than other property owners for comparable parcels and benefits.
 
Los Angeles Unified is not obligated to support the formation of the Lighting District. Regardless of Los Angeles Unified’s support, if the Lighting District is approved, Los Angeles Unified will be required to pay its special assessment unless there has been a formal determination that it is exempt. 
 
The City has limited funding to provide certain services, and the Lighting District is able to supplement services that may benefit the community. Supporting the Lighting District is voluntary by the Board, however, Los Angeles Unified is obligated to pay the special assessment should the City Council vote to pass the Lighting District ballot presented.

Brief Description:
(Selection of Charter Operator to Lease the School Facility Located at 1215 Miramar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90026 and Authorization to Negotiate and Execute Agreements) Recommends to approve the selection of Los Angeles Academy for Arts and Enterprise (LAAAE) as the charter operator for the Central Los Angeles High School #12 (CLAHS#12) school facility, located at 1215 Miramar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90026 (Miramar Site), and enter into any reasonable agreements for the transaction to allow LAAAE to operate the Miramar Site.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the selection of LAAAE as the successful proposer, pursuant to the court-ordered Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for the Miramar Site, and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive and/or her designee(s) to negotiate and execute the Charter School Facilities Program (CSFP) Memorandum of Understanding (CSFP MOU), a Lease and Joint Use Agreement (Lease) and any other reasonable instruments to effectuate this transaction, including, but not limited to, a Development Agreement to allow for repairs to the Miramar Site.
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2005, the Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) intended to develop the 1.37-acre District-owned property, now known as the Miramar Site, into a 19-classroom, 500-seat high school to relieve overcrowding at Belmont High School, formerly known as the CLAHS #12 Project (Project). In 2007 Los Angeles Unified unfunded 18 new construction projects as those projects were no longer needed for Districtwide two-semester operation, which included the CLAHS #12 Project. 
 
In 2009, Los Angeles Unified designated CLAHS #12 for charter school operations to address the increasing demand for secondary charter school facilities within the Belmont High School attendance area. Los Angeles Unified initiated a process to select a charter operator to fund the construction and operation of CLAHS #12.  
 
In 2010, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued to identify a charter operator for the Miramar Site. In 2012, Los Angeles Unified authorized the execution of a long-term lease and related instruments with Camino Nuevo Charter Academy (Camino Nuevo), the charter operator selected as part of the RFP process. As part of this transaction, Camino Nuevo was required to finance the construction of the CLAHS#12 Project at the Miramar Site. Camino Nuevo provided CSFP financing of $21.9 million, which included a $10 million State CSFP loan. The CSFP funding required Los Angeles Unified to enter into the CSFP MOU with Camino Nuevo and the State. The cost to construct the Miramar Site was approximately $30.8 million and Los Angeles Unified funded approximately $5.14M with charter bond program funds.
 
The Project was constructed in 2013, and Camino Nuevo began operating the Miramar Site under a 40-year lease as of July 1, 2013. After approximately seven and a half years, Camino Nuevo’s board voted to close the school effective June 30, 2021, due to declining enrollment and an inability to meet its financial obligations.
 
Pursuant to the CSFP MOU requirements, if a charter ceases operation in a CSFP-funded facility, Los Angeles Unified must:
1.                     Afford the charter up to six months if under revocation or non-renewal review;
2.                     Make reasonable efforts to identify a qualifying successor charter school; or
3.                     Operate the site as a District school and assume repayment of the CSFP loan, or declare the site surplus and dispose of it per State law.
 
Los Angeles Unified issued a Notice of Intent (NOI) on March 18, 2021, to solicit proposals for a successor charter school.  On June 8, 2021, the Board approved Alliance College Ready Public Schools (Alliance) as the successor operator, however, Alliance later withdrew.  Los Angeles Unified and the State subsequently issued an RFQ in December 2021.  However, the RFQ was subsequently cancelled in October 2022 before Ednovate Charter School could be authorized as the successor operator.
 
In 2022, the State filed suit against Los Angeles Unified.  As a result of the litigation, in late 2024 the court ordered that a new RFQ be issued and on July 1, 2025, Los Angeles Unified released the court-ordered RFQ for the Miramar Site.  The new RFQ was developed in conjunction with the State and contained substantially the same requirements as the previous RFQ, including: 
1.                     A minimum enrollment of 425 students, or demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 425 by July 1, 2026;
2.                     An agreement by the proposer to assume the outstanding CSFP loan balance (approximately $8.08 million) (CSFP Loan); 
3.                     Demonstration of financial soundness under CSFP Program Regulations Section 10154 (Financial Soundness); and 
4.                     Execution of a Lease with the District for the remaining 32-year CSFP lease term for the Miramar Site.  
 
The RFQ also provided an opportunity for a proposer to reimburse the District for $750,000 in costs previously incurred by Camino Nuevo for the operation and maintenance of the Miramar Site (M&O Costs).
 
LAAAE submitted the only proposal in response to the RFQ.  The State reviewed LAAAE’s financial records and projections and determined that LAAAE meets the threshold of Financial Soundness and can meet its financial obligations pursuant to its proposal, including, assuming the CSFP Loan, payment of the pro-rata share pursuant to the Lease, payment to the District of the M&O Costs, and the financial means to make necessary repairs to the facility prior to occupancy.  While LAAAE’s current enrollment is below the 425-student threshold established in the RFQ, the State believes LAAAE can reach enrollment of 429 by July 1, 2026, based on the documentation and explanation submitted by LAAAE. The State believes LAAAE demonstrates program growth and fiscal stability and the State sought and obtained approval of Financial Soundness on September 25, 2025, from its governing board.
 
LAAAE has agreed to sign the necessary agreements with the State and the District, and committed to satisfy all State and Los Angeles Unified requirements, including paying $750,000 for the M&O Costs within 60 days of signing the agreements.  LAAAE has no current pending or filed legal issues, claims, causes of action, lawsuits, or disputes against the State or Los Angeles Unified and the State and Los Angeles Unified do not have any against LAAAE.    
 
LAAAE is an independent charter school authorized by the Board on August 2004 for a maximum of 500 students in 6th through 12th grades.  LAAAE’s latest charter petition was renewed on March 2020 for a term of five (5) years.  Due to COVID, the term of its charter petition was legislatively extended for three (3) additional years, which extended LAAAE’s charter petition to June 30, 2027.  LAAAE has been in operation since 2005 and serves a large population of underprivileged students and 12% of its student population qualifies for Special Education.  LAAAE has operated on the Roybal Learning Center campus (Roybal) and is currently co-located at the Belmont High School campus.  LAAAE proposes to serve up to 500 students in 6th through 12th grade at the Miramar Site.  Although LAAAE will not be able to occupy the Miramar Site until the necessary repairs have been completed, which requires District plan review and approval, LAAAE has agreed to: 
1.                     Sign all necessary agreements upon 45 days following approval by the Board;
2.                     Pay the $750,000 outstanding M&O Costs within 60 days;
3.                     Begin making payments on the CSFP Loan per the terms negotiated with the State. 
 
LAAAE is expected to occupy the Miramar Site and relocate from Belmont High School as soon as feasible in the 2026-2027 school year.  Upon execution of the agreements and other reasonable instruments, the Miramar Site will be LAAAE’s responsibility to secure and maintain.  Upon occupancy, for the first three (3) years, Los Angeles Unified will maintain the Miramar Site at LAAAE’s sole cost and expense.  Thereafter, LAAAE may elect to assume the maintenance obligations by notifying Los Angeles Unified in writing of their election, and LAAAE must adhere to Los Angeles Unified’s maintenance standards and requirements.  Additionally, LAAAE will waive its Proposition 39 rights (as codified at Ed. Code Section 47614, and Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 11969.1‐11969.9 or otherwise) (Prop. 39) for the term of the Lease.
 
The Miramar School Site is located within the boundaries of MacArthur Park Community of Schools, Local District Central, and Board District 2 (Rocio Rivas).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approve the selection of LAAAE as the successor charter school to occupy the Miramar Site and authorize staff to negotiate and execute reasonable agreements for the occupancy and maintenance of the facility.
  
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “yes” vote by the Board will authorize the Chief Facilities Executive or her designee to negotiate and execute the Lease and any other reasonable  agreements for LAAAE’s operation of a 6th - 12th grade program and to  effectuate this transaction, including, but not limited to, the CSFP MOU and a Development Agreement to allow for LAAAE to make repairs to the Miramar Site.  LAAAE will be able to relocate its program from its co-located space at Belmont High School to the Miramar Site and Los Angeles Unified will be able to collect the M&O Costs.  Additionally, Los Angeles Unified will no longer be responsible for the security and maintenance of the Miramar Site which has cost Los Angeles Unified over $1,050,000 to date.
 
A “no” vote without a just excuse would violate the court’s order and likely subject the District, the Board and the Superintendent to civil penalties and possibly even harsher criminal penalties for continued non-compliance.  A “no” vote would also prevent LAAAE from operating, occupying, repairing and maintaining the Miramar Site, as well as from assuming the associated financial obligations owed to the State.  If the proposal is not approved Los Angeles Unified would continue to incur security and maintenance costs for the Miramar Site.  LAAAE would still be eligible to request classroom space under Prop. 39 and may continue to be co-located at Belmont High School.  Los Angeles Unified will also not be able to collect the $750,000 in M&O Costs and the State will not be able to collect the CSFP Loan.  Additionally, the District would be required to issue a new RFQ to comply with the court’s order.  
Policy Implications: 
This action does not alter existing Los Angeles Unified policy.  However, Camino Nuevo’s default on its CSFP-related obligations to the State and the District is the first known default under a CSFP agreement tied to a Los Angeles Unified property, necessitating the successor-operator process and associated State oversight.
 
Budget Impact: 
The activities associated with negotiating and executing agreements with LAAAE will require staff time from the Facilities Services Division and the Office of the General Counsel, however, no additional funding is needed to implement this action.
 
Upon Board approval and execution of agreements, the Los Angeles Unified will receive a $750,000 lump-sum reimbursement for the M&O Costs for the Miramar Site, to be deposited into the General Fund.  Los Angeles Unified will be able to cease securing and maintaining the Miramar School Site which will result in savings of over $20,000 per month.
 
Student Impact:
By relocating to the Miramar Site, LAAAE would provide its students  with access to on-site facilities including a library, multi-purpose room, and a fully equipped food services kitchen, as well as adjacent physical education spaces at Miguel Contreras Learning Complex (MCLC). Upon occupancy of the Miramar Site, LAAAE intends to relocate from its current locations and operate the program at the Miramar Site.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
The Miramar Site was heavily vandalized and damaged during the time that it has been vacant.  LAAAE will not be able to occupy the Miramar Site until the facility is repaired and is safe to occupy.  LAAAE will be responsible for paying for the costs to repair the facility to meet, among others, Los Angeles Unified’s standards and specifications.
 
In order to qualify as the successor charter school, and assume payment of the outstanding CSFP Loan, LAAAE must meet the State’s criteria for Financial Soundness.  The court-ordered RFQ requires that LAAAE meet a minimum enrollment of 425 students or demonstrated ability to grow to an enrollment of 425 by July 1, 2026.  LAAAE has provided information detailing how it intends to grow to 425 students.  The State determined that LAAAE has met the threshold of Financial Soundness and is able to assume the CSFP Loan which was approved at the September 25, 2025 meeting of the Charter School Finance Authority.  In addition to being able to pay for the CSFP Loan, the State determined LAAAE is also able to meet its financial obligations under the Lease, pay the M&O Costs in the amount of $750,000 and pay for the repairs to the Miramar Site.  The shared goal of the State and Los Angeles Unified is to select a qualifying successor charter school and implement assumption of the CSFP Loan upon Board approval and execution of the Lease and other necessary agreements.
 
If the Board approves the selection of LAAAE and authorizes the Chief Facilities Executive, and/or designee(s), to execute the Lease and any other reasonable instruments, staff will proceed to negotiate and execute the required documents with LAAAE, including terms reflecting assumption of the CSFP Loan and payment of the $750,000 M&O Costs to the Los Angeles Unified.
 
Subject to final Lease terms, Los Angeles Unified will provide site maintenance and operations at LAAAE’s cost pursuant to Los Angeles Unified standards, with the option for LAAAE, after an initial transition period, to self-perform M&O in accordance with Los Angeles Unified standards and at its sole expense.  LAAAE will also reimburse the Los Angeles Unified for its proportionate share of costs associated with use of MCLC physical education facilities.

Certification of Unhoused Pupils for Charter School Facilities Program Applications

Brief Description:
(Certification of Unhoused Pupils for Charter School Facilities Program Application) Recommends adoption of a resolution to fulfill the requirements of the California Code of Regulations Title 2 Section 1859.162.1, in support of Port of Los Angeles High School’s (POLAHS) independent application for funding under the Charter Schools Facilities Program (CSFP).
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt attached resolution (Exhibit A) certifying that zero state-recognized unhoused pupils in grades K-12 and in the Special Day Class (SDC) Non-Severe and Severe programs will be served by the charter school new-construction project for which POLAHS will independently submit a CSFP funding application by October 30, 2025 (Resolution).
end
 
Body
Background: 
In 2002, Assembly Bill (AB) 14 created the CSFP. Through the passage of Propositions 47 (2002), 55 (2004), 1D (2006), 51 (2016), and 2 (2024), $2 billion in state bond authority has been made available for the construction of new charter school facilities or the rehabilitation of school district facilities that are at least 15 years old for charter school use. The Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) is administering a single filing round, which opened on July 3, 2025, to allocate the entire $600 million CSFP bond authority from Proposition 2. Applications for this filing round must be submitted to the OPSC and the Charter School Finance Authority (CSFA) by October 30, 2025.
 
Upon receipt of a charter school’s notice of intent to apply for CSFP funds, LAUSD, using the method adopted by the Board of Education in May 2007 (Exhibit B), must determine its number of “unhoused pupils,” defined as the number of pupils by which the District’s projected enrollment exceeds its existing classroom capacity. If there are unhoused pupils, the District must use the method to determine how many of those unhoused pupils will be served by the proposed charter school project.  Pursuant to 2 CCR Section 1859.162.1, this result must be certified by the District’s governing board in a resolution presented at a regularly scheduled, publicly held board meeting and submitted to the Office of Public School Construction within 90 days of the District’s receipt of notification that the charter school intends to apply for CSFP funding.  The deadline for charter schools to notify the District of plans to submit CSFP applications during the current funding cycle was September 30, 2025.
 
At the time of the LAUSD Board’s August 26, 2025 meeting, LAUSD staff had received two letters of intent to apply for CSFP funding, all of which were for proposed projects serving K-12 and/or SDC non-severe pupils and located on non-LAUSD sites.  At that meeting, the Board certified that zero unhoused K-12 or SDC non-severe pupils will be served by charter schools submitting CSFP applications during the current funding cycle (Exhibit C).  Subsequently, however, POLAHS, which, in addition to grade 9-12 and SDC non-severe pupils, serves SDC severe pupils, notified the District of its plans to submit a CSFP application.  Application of the District’s May 2007 method shows that zero unhoused SDC severe pupils will be served by POLAHS’s project, and an additional resolution is now required to certify this fact.  The deadline for submitting this resolution to OPSC is December 3, 2025.
 
Note that, under CSFP regulations, all charter schools intending to submit CSFP applications during the current funding cycle will remain eligible for funding even if the school district certifies that zero unhoused pupils will be served.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt the Resolution, thus fulfilling the requirements of California Code of Regulations Title 2, Section 1859.162.1. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Board approval of the proposed action will ensure compliance with 2 CCR section 1859.162.1 requirements and will allow POLAHS to proceed with its CSFP application. This will not affect LAUSD’s new-construction eligibility since no unhoused pupils will be served by the POLAHS project. However, if the proposed action is deferred or not approved, LAUSD will be in noncompliance with 2 CCR 1859.162.1, and POLAHS will be unable to proceed with its CSFP funding application, which could result in a legal dispute between LAUSD and the school.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action will not change current LAUSD policy. A Board resolution certifying the number of unhoused pupils is essential in meeting CSFP requirements for charter schools applying on their own behalf.
 
Budget Impact: 
District funding is not required for the adoption of the Resolution.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed action will enable POLAHS to file a CSFP application for state funding, thus helping it provide safe and effective learning environments for its students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Not applicable.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Once a charter school applicant submits its CSFP application, it will proceed through the state’s regulatory process for scoring, prioritization, and potential award.  If selected for funding, the project will continue through the state’s funding process, with all required reporting administered by the state and performed by the charter school’s staff.  This portion of the process does not involve or impact District staff, students, or budget.

(Integrated Pest Management Policy Revision) Recommends approval of the update to the existing LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team Policy to allow for a simple majority  quorum and the selection of Team member alternates. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
The Board of Education (“Board”) is asked to update the existing LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Team (“Team”) Policy to allow for a simple majority quorum and the selection of Team member alternates. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”). The Team serves to provide guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property, and the environment.  
 
Since returning from fully remote participation during the COVID-19 global pandemic, the TEAM has experienced challenges meeting quorum.  The main basis for this challenge is the original Policy requiring a quorum of 10 members, as opposed to a simple majority quorum. The Team is comprised of 15 Team members, which makes a simple quorum 8 (as opposed to the currently required 10).   
 
Over the course of several meetings, the IPM Team has made clear and requested that the Board amend the Policy to reflect a simple majority quorum.   
 
The IPM Team further would like to instate a process for the approval and maintenance of IPM Team member alternates so that the business of the Team can continue uninterrupted even in the absence of existing regular members. IPM Team alternates will attend all IPM meetings so as to be informed of the material the Team is addressing.  Additionally, alternates shall be selected, proposed, and approved in the same manner as existing members: (a) Proposed alternates must fit within the constituencies as defined by existing Policy, (b) must be proposed by the IPM Team itself, (c) must prepare and submit ethics forms and brief bio, and (d) must be approved by the Board. IPM Team alternates shall have the power to vote and shall count towards quorum when acting as alternates for absent regular members.  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The IPM Team will be able to meet quorum more easily, thereby dramatically increasing the likelihood of meetings where discussion and action can legally take place within the framework of the Brown Act.  
 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges. Quorum will continue to be a real challenge to meet, and the Team will be unable to carry out the duties they are charged with under the IPM Policy.  
 
Policy Implications: 
Positive policy implications are anticipated, as the work of the Team will proceed as envisioned and articulated by the Policy.

description
Whereas, In October 2025, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency through a “Proclamation of Local Emergency for Federal Immigration Actions” in order to provide those most impacted with resources including economic relief, eviction protections, and other assistance; and in December 2024, LA City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance in to prohibit the use of city resources, personnel, property and data for federal immigration enforcement;
 
Whereas, Since the beginning of 2025, in Los Angeles and across the region, communities have witnessed heightened attacks on our most vulnerable communities, including Black, LGBTQ+, and immigrants, as a result of policies and rhetoric enacted by the federal administration; 
 
Whereas, As a result of those heightened attacks, Los Angeles Unified School District students and family members have been targeted, arrested, detained, and deported to their home countries within a matter of days;
 
Whereas, Communities are experiencing a widespread fear of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, detentions, and deportations near and around our schools consequently creating chaos and economic uncertainty as a result of family separations, job loss, housing destabilization, and movement across the region; 
 
Whereas, Recent immigration enforcement efforts have created fear, sorrow, and anxiety in our communities negatively impacting the mental health of young people. According to the 2025 BlueSky Youth Mental Health Survey, over 81 percent of youth respondents expressed concern with discrimination against immigrants;
 
Whereas, Particular communities across the greater Los Angeles region are being racially profiled and targeted. The map “Areas of Focus for Immigration Activity” produced by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) highlighted the communities of the San Fernando Valley (Pacoima and North Hills), South LA (Jefferson Park and Westmont), and Southeast LA (Norwalk, Bellflower, Downey, South Gate) as the communities with the highest immigration enforcement activity between June 6 and July 20, 2025;
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has reaffirmed its commitment to making Los Angeles Unified School District a sanctuary district through resolutions  “Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-093- 16/17), and “Reaffirm that Los Angeles Unified School District Will Be a Sanctuary District and Safe Zone for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-034-24/25); 
 
Whereas, In July of 2025, the Board unanimously approved the resolution “Upholding Our Constitutional Rights and Standing with Immigrant Communities” (Res-086-24/25) which condemns the militarization of immigrant communities, including any uninvited deployment of federal agents, National Guard personnel, in our schools and communities without local request and transparent civilian oversight;
 
Whereas, The District has responded by expanding the We Are One campaign, which includes regular Know Your Rights trainings, emergency preparedness plans, educating individuals of their civil rights when interacting with immigration enforcement officers, strengthening partnerships with community organizations and service providers, establishing and implementing protocols for when ICE attempts to enter our campuses, and other mental, financial and legal supports for impacted students and families;
 
Whereas, Community members, organizations and labor partners in the greater Los Angeles area have organized rapid response and mutual aid networks; organized and led Know Your Rights trainings for community members, students, and educators; documented ICE raids that have provided the basis for lawsuits against the federal administration; demonstrated a commitment to keeping our students safe by being present at schools during the first week of school; and communicating with board members and other District leaders to offer support;

Body
Background: 
On March 23, 1999, the District’s Board adopted and implemented the LAUSD Integrated Pest Management Policy (“Policy”). The Team serves to provides guidance, verification and recommendations to support the District’s goal of Integrated Pest Management for the safest and lowest risk approach to control pest problems while protecting people, property, and the environment.  
 
From time to time, vacancies occur, and these vacancies must be filled by approval of proposed individuals by the Board.  The prospective members are proposed by the IPM team itself, or comes from one of the constituencies as defined by the original Policy. 
 
The current vacancies needing to be filled are (1) a public health representative, (2) a District non-management representative from Maintenance and Operations, and (3) a representative from LAUSD Office of Environmental Health and Safety. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the three proposed members to fill existing vacancies in order to provide for a full Team as directed by the IPM Policy.  The Team and all members will operate consistent with the terms of the Policy.  
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Failure to approve the individuals as members of the Team will result in organizational and administrative challenges. Quorum will be a challenge to meet, and constituencies required by the Policy will remain unrepresented.

description
Whereas, The increasing frequency and severity of extreme heat events, wildfires, and other climate driven disasters demand immediate action, and local agencies like the Los Angeles Unified School District cannot afford to wait for state or federal intervention alone, but must act with urgency to safeguard the health, safety, and learning conditions of students and staff; 
 
Whereas, The impacts of the climate crisis fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color, whose neighborhoods often lack access to cooling systems, tree canopy, shade, and resilient infrastructure, making it imperative that the District lead with equity by prioritizing policies and investments that protect those most vulnerable; 
 
Whereas, These unequal impacts are not accidental, but the result of decades of intentional disinvestment, redlining, and environmental racism that have left Black, brown, immigrant, and low-income students learning in campuses with fewer resources and greater exposure to climate hazards;
Whereas, The District has invested in making our campuses greener and more resilient, but many campuses still have outdated cooling infrastructure and lack shade and climate resilient designs, which can lead to disrupted instruction and negative impacts on student learning both in classrooms and in outdoor education; 
 
Whereas, Green spaces are a critical component of mitigating extreme heat and improving air quality, and the District, as outlined in the Green Schools for All Resolution (Res 002-22/23), has established a 30% green space and 20% tree canopy standard for its playgrounds and has committed $1.2B from Measure US towards meeting those ambitious goals; 
 
Whereas, While recognizing the need for some blacktop and open hard surfaces to meet physical education, green spaces have proven benefits when leveraged for physical activity, play spaces, and outdoor learning classrooms;
 
 Whereas, Beyond the significant detriments to health and wellbeing, there are serious concerns around the impacts of heat exposure to children’s learning. A recent systemic review published in July 2025 in PLOS Climate found that extended exposure to heat impairs students’ cognitive abilities, negatively affecting their academic performance; 
 
Whereas, Artificial turf adds to the impacts of extreme heat, since it absorbs and retains far more solar radiation than natural grass creating surface temperatures reaching in excess of 160 degrees, exacerbating the urban heat island effect, with growing body of research and health and environmental experts expressing concerns over the potential for harm including burns, chemical exposure, and other injuries (L.A. Times, September, 2025); 
 
Whereas, Extreme heat does not impact all schools equally, with the harshest impacts borne by campuses in dense, heat-burdened neighborhoods that already lack trees, parks, and cooling infrastructure, leaving students in these communities more exposed to dangerous conditions and less able to learn in safe environments;
 
Whereas, The growing impacts of extreme heat demand a comprehensive approach to protect the health and safety of students and staff, requiring the District to evaluate and address multiple vulnerabilities at once including the environmental and health risks posed by artificial turf, the strain of aging HVAC systems during heat waves, and the uneven access to critical protections such as shade structures and hydration stations, so that all campuses are adequately prepared to mitigate the dangers of rising temperatures;
 
Whereas, The District has created tools for response to extreme weather events, including the issuing of heat advisories with recommendations and the Enhanced Emergency Preparedness Bulletin to support school leaders in making timely and informed decisions during heat-related natural disasters, including through the use of the Natural Disaster Decision-Making Matrix, Tiered Fire Support system, and new tools such as the Wildfire Decision-Making Tree;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that school buildings must have actionable plans in place for temporarily posturing their buildings and HVAC systems to reduce the negative impact of extreme heat, wildfire smoke, and other potential airborne contaminants, as well as an actionable plan in place to return to normal operation and verify proper operation of all HVAC systems;
 
Whereas, Shade, through trees, canopies, and other natural or built features, is one of the most effective and immediate protections and the District’s facilities division has committed to a goal of at least 20% shade coverage when undertaking campus greening projects, it is critical to assess current progress toward the benchmark and adopt a clear actionable strategy to meet it; yet schools in historically redlined and under-resourced neighborhoods continue to have the least shade coverage, leaving their students disproportionately exposed to unsafe outdoor conditions; and 
 
Whereas, Funds from voter-approved bond measures including LAUSD’s local facilities bond Measure US, and state bond measures Proposition 2 and Proposition 4 create an opportunity to further prioritize District capital investments to increase the build out of renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems on District property to sustainably power upgraded HVAC systems, ensuring long-term cost savings and climate resilience for campuses, and urgent action is needed to secure federal clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits before they expire; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District shall update its disaster preparedness plans to ensure a comprehensive response to escalating threats posed by extreme heat and related climate emergencies including wildfires so that they clearly outline (1) decision-makers and clear metrics for operational procedures such as shifting school schedules and closures, (2) guidance on continuity of instruction, (3) notification of school site leaders, staff, and families on District response and any other necessary information that can be shared in coordination with City and County emergency response agencies, and (4) include necessary training for staff on the updated protocols. This process shall solicit feedback from all relevant District divisions, labor partners, school site staff, families, students, and community stakeholders, to ensure the plan reflects on the ground needs, and report back to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District in 90 days; 
 
Resolved further, That considering the need to ensure our campus infrastructure can address extreme heat events, the District shall:
 
•                     Accelerate HVAC system replacements in alignment with the existing MERV 13 standards, with the goal of having at least 20-25 projects (standalone HVAC system upgrades and/or as a component of a larger project, excluding comprehensive modernization projects) underway at all times, with annual progress reports to the Board included in the annual update of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan. Standalone projects at campuses shall continue to be prioritized based on system condition, and where schools cannot be maintained at below the Cal/OSHA indoor temperature standard of 82 degrees Fahrenheit, with subsequent consideration given to student need (such as SENI ranking) and community climate burden (such as CalEnviro Screen and extreme heat exposure);
•                     Implement, to the extent feasible, the use of climate-friendly, all electric technologies such as heat pumps, in HVAC modernization projects, aligned with the District’s goals to transition to 100% clean, renewable energy, and where feasible, to incorporate opportunities for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to sustainably power upgraded HVAC systems;
•                     Provide an update by the end of the 2025-2026 school year on progress on the District’s strategy from the Business Services and Operations Division for the deployment of additional heat mitigation measures such as expanded tree canopy, shade structures, nature-based cooling solutions such as native plantings and permeable surfaces, hydration stations, and misting systems to ensure students and staff have access to cooling space and protection from heat, including how the deployment strategy prioritizes communities most impacted by extreme heat and air pollution;
•                     Prepare and present an Interim Heat Mitigation Plan to protect students and staff at schools with aging HVAC systems, with limited shade coverage under 20%, and where indoor temperatures cannot be maintained below the 82 degree indoor temperature threshold set by Cal/OSHA. The plan will outline short-term strategies to reduce heat exposure, including the use of portable cooling units, hydration stations, and designated cool zones; adjusted schedules and outdoor activity modifications during peak heat. The plans will ensure frontline schools in historically disinvested communities (based on SENI ranking, extreme heat exposure or CalEnviroScreen exposure as described above) receive protections so they are not forced to bear disproportionate risks while awaiting full modernization. Clear communication protocols will ensure timely guidance to school leaders and families, bridging the gap until full modernization efforts are complete;
•                     Ensure adequate staffing for the ongoing repair and maintenance of HVAC systems, shade structures, hydration stations, and other critical heat-mitigation infrastructure, with staffing levels reviewed annually to align with Districtwide needs and equity priorities;
•                     Develop a plan to verify the proper operation of all existing HVAC systems through Ventilation Verification, using appropriately qualified and certified personnel consistent with applicable code, manufacturer requirements, recognized engineering and public health standards, and state standards established under AB 841 (CalSHAPE) and applicable ASHRAE and Title 24 requirement, taking into consideration the recommendations of UC Davis and the National Energy Management Institute recommendations; and
•                     Explore opportunities to apply for Proposition 2 and 4 funding to help address the heat mitigation goals, campus greening, energy efficiency and the clean energy goals and prioritize District applications to these and other funding sources to build on the District’s Measure US investments to enhance air quality, add green space, and protect the health of students, staff, and families;
 
Resolved further, That in recognition of the significant environmental and climate consequences of artificial turf, including the release of microplastics, into soil and waterways, and its absorption and radiation of heat that exacerbates the urban heat island effect, the District shall update its policy to:
 
•                     Prohibit installation of artificial turf at early education centers, primary centers, elementary schools, and middle schools, regardless of funding source;
•                     Prioritize the replacement of existing artificial turf at early education centers (EECs) and Elementary schools, in particular, as they reach their end-of-life with grass, plants, or natural materials to the extent feasible; including potential pilots for natural groundcover as an alternative to grass that still provide safe play areas but require less water and lower maintenance, with pilots prioritized for schools in communities that have been historically under-resourced and disproportionately burdened by extreme heat, pollution, and lack of access to safe green space;
•                     Temporarily pause projects not yet approved by the Board to replace synthetic turf until after a comprehensive study and policy update (described below) has been completed and the Board has given direction about the future of these fields (to remain synthetic turf or convert to natural grass) and develop contingency plans to ensure impacted students have access to necessary play and athletic spaces during this period;
•                     Identify funding to:
 
o                     Conduct a lifecycle cost and operations comparison of synthetic and natural turf athletic fields, covering installation, maintenance, water use, expected service life; field availability (e.g., hours of play between maintenance/closures); and end-of-life removal/disposal;
o                     Perform a comprehensive synthesis of current literature, research and government studies on synthetic and natural turf, including runoff/microplastics, injury/health outcomes, environmental/climate impact, incorporating available District data;
o                     Assess heat-exposure conditions on synthetic turf fields (e.g., surface temperature profiles and thresholds) and, based on the findings, provide operational guidance to schools for mitigation heat exposure, such as scheduling early morning/evening activity, heat advisories, cooling interventions;
o                     Gather input from labor partners, school staff, students, families, and community members;
•                     Findings shall be publicly presented and reviewed at appropriate venues, including meetings of the Governing Board of Education, the Committee of the Whole, and the Greening Schools & Climate Resilience Committee, to ensure transparency. All resulting policy updates must explicitly address equity impacts and demonstrate how the District will correct historic patterns of underinvestment in schools serving Black, brown, immigrant, indigenous and low-income communities; and
 
Resolved further, That the District shall establish a clear, districtwide Heat-Stroke Emergency Prevention and Response Protocol for all school sites to ensure prompt and consistent action when a student or staff member shows signs of heat stroke. The protocol shall apply to all school environments both indoors and outdoors, and include: immediate activation of emergency medical services; clear expectations for monitoring as outlined by LAUSD Guidelines for Preventing Heat Stress Bulletin 963.3, dated July 14, 2025; guidance on beginning rapid on-site cooling using available equipment, including portable solutions that can be deployed immediately without relying on electricity, ice, or refrigerated storage; written procedures assessable to all staff; and annual training for staff who supervise outdoor activities so they can recognize symptoms and respond quickly; and
 
Resolved further, That the District shall complete this study, transmit the findings to the Board, and use them to update the Policy Bulletin, which shall be brought back to the Board in Spring 2026; and, be it, finally
 
Resolved, That regular updates on extreme heat mitigation and the District’s response shall be included in the annual report of the Office of Eco-Sustainability, to the Committee of the Whole, the Greening Schools and Climate Resilience Committee, and the LAUSD-UTLA Joint Climate Task Force.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

description
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District (District) is committed to improving and maintaining state-of-the-art facilities-including 1,200 schools and 21,000 buildings-that maximize student learning, provide enrichment opportunities, and serve the public and community;
 
Whereas, The District strives to manage public funds and District-owned properties with transparency, efficiency, and accountability;
 
Whereas, Any use of school facilities or access to District owned property must be documented and authorized by an agreement such as a civic center permit, filming permit, or license agreement. The Real Estate and Business Development department within the District’s Facilities Service Division is responsible for processing and preparing these agreements. These agreements allow users to access the District’s public facilities, and generate approximately $15 million in annual revenue for the District;
 
Whereas, The Civic Center Act detailed in California Education Code §§ 38130-38139 requires school districts to make their facilities available for community use when not needed for school purposes. Local organizations and members of the public may utilize District facilities for recreation and sports, public meetings and forums, arts, music, and cultural events, childcare, and more; 
 
Whereas, Each school district adopts its own board policy and administrative regulations implementing the Civic Center Act including application processes, priority use schedules, fee structure, insurance and liability coverage, and permitted activities;   
 
Whereas, The District adopted BUL-6894.1 entitled, ""Procedures for Third-Party Use of School Facilities” in February 2018 and has not since updated the policies and procedures;
 
Whereas, Partners and members of the community currently utilize District owned property-including schools, athletic fields, and gyms-for a variety of purposes including community meetings, athletic and enrichment activities, camps, carnivals, filming and more;
 
Whereas, Given the broad scope of duty to manage 21,000 buildings and its charge to address Proposition 39 charter school facilities agreements, the District’s Real Estate and Leasing Department is overextended beyond its capacity to thoroughly assess District assets and it is vital to provide appropriate customer service to members of the community who may be interested in utilizing district facilities; 
 
Whereas, The District should consider realigning the Real Estate and Leasing Department around four key functional areas: including 1) licensing/access, 2) asset management, 3) revenue generation, and 4) compliance;
 
Whereas, The District’s current system to receive and process agreements is inefficient and is not designed to handle the complexity, volume, or opportunity presented by the number and types of District facilities available for third-party use;
 
Whereas, Currently, District facilities are underutilized for community use beyond the school day, which represents untapped opportunity for community benefit and revenue generation for the District;
 
Whereas, Unlike in other systems, members of the public cannot currently access a centralized portal to view or request facility use, and internal systems lack automation, performance monitoring, and transparency; and
 
Whereas, A centralized digital platform with online applications, automated alerts, and public-facing access is necessary to streamline operations, improve customer experience, and reduce compliance risk; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That in order to improve the community and partner use of Los Angeles Unified School District (District) facilities and to maximize revenue to the District, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School (Board) directs the District to:
 
•                     Determine funding and issue Request for Proposal(s) (RFP) for an updated, centralized, online real estate and facilities management platform to support intake, workflow tracking, agreement management, and performance monitoring. The system should be user-friendly and include:
o                     Automated deadline alerts and internal notifications for District staff
o                     Public-facing tools for site browsing, pricing, online applications, and online payments (i.e., ACH, credit card);
o                     External notifications sent to external partners at a minimum of three weeks before the facilities will be used for the event;
•                     Coordinate with and support school administrators to align site availability, community access, and scheduling, and develop a plan to centralize a facility use calendar and communication plan to support higher utilization and equitable access;
•                     Evaluate options and develop a plan to update and simplify the public facing website to make facility options and pricing structures more transparent and responsive to community needs;
 
Resolved further, That the District shall review and revise its policy and procedures regarding facilities access, use, and fees, including to reflect recent legislation, demand and availability, and equity considerations. The updated policy should include:
•                     Criteria to prioritize access, where feasible, for organizations that serve underserved youth-including those with disabilities, and LGBTQ or gender nonconforming youth-as well as those that provide free or low-cost programs focused on sports, play, and enrichment;
•                     A tiered cost structure for the use of District facilities that takes into account the applicant’s status (e.g., nonprofit vs. for-profit, and/or municipalities and other government entities), event participants and/or users including District students and families, and the type of programming or services provided (e.g., tenant rights clinics, immigration rights clinics, counseling services, unhoused student/family supports, early education centers and childcare programs for children birth to age five, and housing assistance), and whether that programming or services are free or fee-based;
 
Resolved further, That District facilities work closely with Risk Management to streamline processes on the appropriate documentation needed in conjunction with the services offered by specific organizations, such as medical organizations, athletic organizations, etc.;
 
Resolved further, That the District will support Parent/Teacher Associations, Parent/Teacher Organizations, non-profit Booster organizations, etc., through a simple renewal process for facility use, allowing recurring rentals based on rental history; and
 
Resolved, That the District report back to the Board within 120 days with the revised policy and plan to achieve the actions outlined above, including timelines, cost estimates, revenue estimates, potential uses of revenues, and staffing needs to support implementation of the plan by the beginning of the 2026-2027 school year.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

(Provisional Internship Permit) Recommends approval of 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve request for 6 teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit pursuant to Title 5 California Code of Regulations, Section 80021.1.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July 1, 2005 in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document.  The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed.  During the first year of employment, the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program.
 
The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit.  Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment.
 
The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit (Attachment A).  
 
Expected Outcomes:
The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification.
 
If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved, and a full-time teacher cannot be hired, classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Permits.  Day-to-day substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program, and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days, after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
These are contracted full time teachers working under a provisional internship permit. The positions are either norm funded, funded by division of special education or purchased by the school site.
 
Student Impact:
The goal of Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom.  In areas of high need such as special education teachers where there might be a teacher shortage, the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits, which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take the necessary steps to enroll in a credential program.

Body
Background: 
This report is presented at each Board Meeting for approval of routine personnel actions.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Not applicable
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Specifically in regard to disciplinary action, a “No” vote may nullify the disciplinary action due to legal time constraints. 
 
A “No” vote impacts the timeliness of processing personnel actions for classified and certificated employees regarding their assignment, salary/rate, transfer, and new appointment and may be in conflict with procedural rights and benefits afforded them under applicable Education Code provisions, Personnel Commission Rules, District Policy, and respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (UTLA, AALA, Teamsters, Los Angeles School Police Sergeants and Lieutenants Association).  Employees have procedural rights that are based on their status (permanent or probationary) associated with the specific personnel action being submitted and the respective rights available to them in accordance with the above.  Additionally, based on Personnel Commission Rules, permanent classified employees have rights to appeals.
 
A ”Yes” vote will approve all actions in accordance with Education Codes & Rules of the Personnel Commission.
 
Policy Implications: 
Not applicable
 
Budget Impact: 
Cost Neutral
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
All actions affecting classified personnel and apprentice personnel reported herein are in accordance with Section 45123-45125, 45135, and 45240-45318 of the Education Code and with the Rules of the Personnel Commission.

Brief Description:
description
(Approval of Non-Formula Grant Agreements: Ratification of Delegated Authority) Recommends the ratification of those actions related to the application for, and receipt of non-formula grants, including the execution of related agreements and documents, taken by the Office of Grants Administration and Office of the Superintendent within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A.” 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the grant actions related to the application for, and receipt of non-formula grants, including the execution of related agreements and documents, taken by the Office of Grants Administration and Office of the Superintendent within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A.”  
end
 
Body
Background: 
Prior to the establishment of the Office of Grants Administration, the District’s approach to grant management was decentralized with multiple departments and schools independently identifying and pursuing supplemental funding for their respective areas when they have available resources to do so.  
 
Pursuant to Delegation No. 42, initially issued by the Board of Education on December 13, 2016, and as most recently amended on December 12, 2017, the Superintendent and/or their designee was authorized to sign on behalf of the Board of Education grant applications, amendments, and related correspondence, such as letters of support, prior to submission. As stated in that delegation, “an action item would be presented to the Board for approval upon receipt of a grant award.” Various other previously issued delegations granted authority to certain Divisions and Offices to accept grant funds and/or to execute grant agreements on behalf of the Board of Education. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the resources and services provided by these non-formula grants to be awarded to the Los Angeles Unified School District and schools that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented, or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information. Non-ratification of non-formula grants awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” may result in immediate unavailability of resources or discontinuance of services, or both. 
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code sections 35161 and 17604, which permit the Board of Education to delegate authority to contract, including by way of grants, in the name of the District, and which the Board exercised on December 12, 2017.
 
Budget Impact: 
The receipt of these non-formula grant funds will result in additional one-time resources for individual schools as grant recipients or in support of districtwide initiatives that could benefit students, staff and the school community. Any grant actions presented that require a matching grant are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.
 
Student Impact:
The grant funds could benefit students directly or indirectly depending on the purpose of the grant.

Community Challenge Grant 2.0 - Renewal to Launch A New Three-Year Cycle

Brief Description:
(Community Challenge Grant 2.0 - Renewal to Launch A New Three-Year Cycle). Recommends approval of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 program and authorization to award a total of $2,100,000 in individual Community Challenge grants over a three-year period, to tax-exempt community organizations to provide high quality enrichment activities outside of the school and school day to Los Angeles Unified District students enrolled in high need schools.
end
 
description
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal of the Community Challenge Grant program (Community Challenge Grant 2.0) for a new three-year term, from January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2029, and authorize the award of individual Community Challenge grants in the range of $25,000-$50,000 to tax-exempt community organizations, up to a total amount of $2,100,000.
 
Body
Background: 
On November 14, 2023, in Board Report 087-23/24, the Board authorized the Procurement Services Division to negotiate and award a total of $2 million in individual Community Challenge grants to tax-exempt community organizations over a three-year period, to provide high-quality after-school enrichment activities and services to District students.  The Division of Communications, Engagement & Collaboration was tasked with the management of outreach activities and convening central office teams to assess Community Challenge grant applications. 
 
A total of 23 grantees provided services for LAUSD students during SY 2024-25, impacting over 700 students and over 80 parents. We anticipate serving over 1,300 students and over 200 parents total within the initial round (Community Challenge Grant 1.0).  
 
In year one of the first round (1.0), grantees implemented innovative programming designed to help students boost literacy, feel a stronger sense of belonging, apply to college, and develop new skills. Families benefited from workshops that prepared them to support their child’s pathway to college. Partners have responded swiftly to urgent needs amid recent immigration actions, and many have also participated in District-led initiatives such as We Are One and Principal for a Day.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Adoption of the renewal of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will allow Los Angeles Unified to expand enrichment support services to students and families at grantee facilities through a second grant cycle that will allow additional grantees to apply. Prior grantees will be invited to reapply. Selected grant recipients will be presented for Board ratification, as they were in the prior round.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Approval of this renewal of the Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will: authorize the District to solicit applications for a new grant cycle; and award a total of $2.1 million in individual Community Challenge grants to tax exempt community organizations within a three-year period to provide additional enrichment opportunities for students and parents outside of the instructional day and in trusted community spaces.
 
If this program is not renewed, Los Angeles Unified will eliminate one opportunity to engage community organizations that have not historically worked directly with the District to provide services.
 
Policy Implications: 
Los Angeles Unified will engage with tax-exempt organizations via grant agreements that will allow enrichment services aligned with the District’s Strategic Plan to be provided off school campuses. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget of $2.1 million in Unrestricted General Funds will allow approximately 21-24 tax-exempt organizations to be awarded $25,000 to $50,000 in grant funds to provide enrichment services to students and parents after school and at their sites. The entire $2.1 million in approved funds are passed through the District to the grantees. Costs associated with staffing, management, overhead and oversight of the grant program are all absorbed by the Office of Development & Civic Engagement. These activities currently utilize approximately 15% of available staffing resources within this Office.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed renewal of the program will support data-informed student and parent needs in academics, wellness, college-readiness, and parent engagement. The program will serve approximately 600-1000 students each school year, which represents grant funding utilization of approximately $1,050- $1,750 per student per annum.
 
Equity Impact:
The Community Challenge Grant 2.0 will give preference to tax-exempt organizations that serve Priority School and High and Highest Need SENI 2.0 school communities. In addition, organizations that have a demonstrated track record of trust and engagement with those communities will also be given preference.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Approval of the program is time sensitive in order to allow for the solicitation of applications, ratification of grant agreements, and execution of grant agreements to be established before May 2026, so that services can be provided as early as Summer 2026.

description
(Approval of Procurement Actions) Recommends the ratification of contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Department within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Ratify the contract actions taken by the Procurement Services Department within delegated authority as listed in Attachment “A” including the approval of award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; Goods and General Services Contracts:  District Card Transactions; Rental Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; General Stores Distribution Center; Book/Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
end
 
Body
Background: 
Procurement Services staff prepares monthly reports for contract actions necessary for the execution of the projects approved by the Board for the educational and operational requirements of the District in accordance with the Board delegated authority to the Superintendent. 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of these items will allow the goods and services provided by these contracts to furnish the equipment, supplies, or services to the Los Angeles Unified School District that support Board policies and goals.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information.  Non-ratification of actions awarded under delegated authority in Attachment “A” will result in immediate unavailability of products or discontinuance of services, or both.  While non-ratification may be legally defendable, it would likely result in costly litigation over discontinued payments or if the District attempts to reclaim payments made to a vendor.  District costs will likely increase as fewer vendors compete for future procurements.  
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy and conforms to California Education Code section 17604 that permits the Board of Education to delegate authority for Procurement Services (Board Report 444-17/18), which the board exercised on May 8, 2018.
 
 
Budget Impact: 
The contract actions presented are within the budget authority previously approved by the Board.  Ratification of contracts awarded under delegation of authority and within their Board budget listed in Attachment “A” includes:
 
•                     Award of Professional Service Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  New Contracts; Purchase Orders; and 
 
•                     Good and General Services Contracts not exceeding $250,000:  Procurement Transactions - Purchase Orders; Rental of Facilities; Travel/Conference Attendance; District Card Transactions; General Stores Distribution Center; and Book Instructional Material Purchase Orders.
 
Student Impact:
Not applicable.
 
Equity Impact:
See Attachment A for applicable items.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
There are no policy implications on these agreements.  The Business and Government Services Teams, Office of the General Counsel, has reviewed and approved the agreements as to form, except where “authorization to negotiate and execute” is sought.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Three Projects to Provide Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of three critical school facility projects to replace and upgrade essential building and site systems, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $9,762,321, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve three projects to provide critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $9,762,321.  
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects including budget modifications and procurement of equipment and materials. 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Priorities for the expenditure of capital funding are evaluated to ensure the District’s most pressing priorities are being addressed. More than 60 percent of Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) school buildings were built more than 50 years ago, with more than $80 billion of unfunded school facilities needs identified Districtwide, and these needs grow every year. As the District’s capital needs far exceed available funding, the most pressing unfunded critical needs will continue to be addressed based on an evaluation of known facilities conditions and needs at schools. Projects developed under this School Upgrade Program category of need, Critical Replacements and Upgrades of School Building/Site Systems and Components, will replace failing building systems that create safety concerns and are disruptive to school operations. Systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or will negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
The project proposals contained in this Board Report align with these priorities. Exhibit A includes roofing replacement projects at Playa Del Rey Elementary School and Chester W. Nimitz Middle School along with a project to renovate the swimming pool at Panorama High School.
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipate that the Board of Education will adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to define and approve three projects that address critical replacement and upgrade needs. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects to improve student health, safety, and educational quality.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to undertake the proposed Projects in accordance with the provisions set forth in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures K, R, Y, Q, RR, and US. If the proposed action is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, and critical replacement and upgrade needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposal is consistent with Los Angeles Unified’s long-term goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve the conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in Los Angeles Unified local bond measures. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness, Modernizing Infrastructure by providing critical replacements and upgrades at schools. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the three proposed Projects is $9,762,321 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical replacements and upgrades of school building/site systems and components. 
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scopes, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project.
 
Student Impact: 
Approval of the proposed Projects enables the District to continue ongoing efforts to undertake facilities improvements that help ensure the approximately 2,650 current and future students attending these three schools are provided with a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.
 
Equity Impact: 
Building components/systems in the worst condition, especially those that pose a safety hazard and/or negatively impact school operations and other building systems if not addressed, will be addressed first.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
It may be necessary to undertake feasibility studies, site analysis, scoping, and/or due diligence activities on the proposed Projects.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve Two Early Education Center Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Projects and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of two projects to provide outdoor classrooms and campus upgrades at early education centers, as detailed in Exhibit A. Also recommends amending the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to include these projects, with a combined budget of $20,115,559, and authorizes the Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Facilities Executive, or designee(s) to take all legally permissible actions to implement the projects, including executing instruments, budget modifications, and procurement of equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
1)                     Define and approve two Early Education Center (EEC) Outdoor Classroom and Campus Upgrade Projects (Projects), as listed on Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The total combined budget for these proposed Projects is $20,115,559.
 
2)                     Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the proposed Projects, including budget modifications and procurement of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
The Los Angeles Unified School District (Los Angeles Unified or District) School Upgrade Program includes a spending target entitled ""Early Childhood Education Facilities Upgrades and Expansions."" Projects developed under this category of need are included in the Facilities SEP. 
 
The proposed Projects will provide outdoor classrooms at Shenandoah Street Early Education Center and 112th St. Early Education Center by dividing the existing playground areas into distinct activity areas with paving, new playground matting, and landscaping. The intent of the proposed Projects is to create dynamic, nature-based outdoor learning spaces to enable the District's youngest learners to acquire a deep, intuitive understanding of the natural world through hands-on experiences. The outdoor classrooms may include learning stations with the following components:
 
•                     Music and movement
•                     Climbing and balance
•                     Messy materials
•                     Nature art
•                     Water play
•                     Sand play
•                     Garden
•                     Dirt digging
•                     Building materials
 
In addition, the proposed Projects will receive campus upgrades which include new heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, roofing, new shade structures, fire alarm system and utilities upgrades, accessibility upgrades, and additional scope as detailed in Exhibit A.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Staff anticipates the Board of Education will define and approve the proposed Projects, as described in Exhibit A, and amend the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein. Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Projects.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to implement the proposed Projects. If the proposal is not approved, Bond Program funds will not be expended, access to nature-based green space will remain limited, and early education facilities needs will remain unaddressed.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action is consistent with the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the proposed Projects is $20,115,559. The proposed Projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Early Childhood Education facilities upgrades and expansions.
 
Each budget for the proposed Projects was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about their proposed scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual budgets for the proposed Projects will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known and/or unforeseen conditions arise, and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each of the proposed Projects.
 
Student Impact: 
The proposed Projects will establish nurturing, nature-based outdoor spaces that support whole-child development and learning to benefit approximately 140 current and future students.
 
Expected developmental outcomes include enhanced imaginative play, increased physical and mental well-being, and environmental stewardship. These outdoor classrooms will encourage and support community, student, and parent engagement through the creation of partnerships that help establish and maintain the newly developed garden spaces. These spaces can also reduce stress for staff, families, and children. Children and their parents will be able to connect with the natural world as a regular part of their healthy growth and development in the areas that lack parks and green environments.
 
Equity Impact:
The proposed Projects were identified by the Early Childhood Education Division (ECED) in consultation with Regions and school site administrators. Sites were selected based upon each center's proximity and access to existing community green space, and evidence of parent, administrator, and staff commitment to the success of the program. Other factors considered included income level, center enrollment, community interest, and demographics.
 
Issues and Analysis:
Staff’s proposal supports ECED’s commitment to providing a quality early education experience that will prepare students for success in school and life, while valuing and respecting the needs, languages, and cultures of all students, families, staff, and respective communities. 
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will evaluate the Projects’ proposals in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act to ensure compliance. If through the planning and design process, it is determined that the proposed Projects’ scopes will not sufficiently address the facilities needs identified, the Projects’ scope, schedule, and budget will be revised accordingly.

Brief Description:
(Define and Approve the 24th Street Elementary School Barrier Removal Project and Amend the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Incorporate Therein) Recommends definition and approval of a barrier removal project at 24th Street Elementary School (Board District 1, Region South) and the amendment of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to incorporate therein with a budget of $432,291; and authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Define and approve the 24th Street Elementary School (School) Barrier Removal Project (Project) and amend the Facilities Services Division (Facilities) Strategic Execution Plan (SEP) to incorporate therein. The budget for the proposed Project is $432,291.
 
Authorize the Chief Procurement Officer and/or the Chief Facilities Executive and/or their designee(s) to execute all reasonable instruments, as legally permissible, to implement the Project including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials.
end
 
Body
Background: 
On October 10, 2017, the Board of Education (Board) approved the Transition Plan under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to further Los Angeles Unified efforts to comply with ADA Title II program accessibility requirements (Transition Plan). The Transition Plan outlined Los Angeles Unified’s proposed approach to providing program accessibility, which considers the characteristics of Los Angeles Unified, student population, variety of educational programs, as well as the existing level of accessibility. The Transition Plan established a specific approach and goals for achieving program accessibility through facility modifications and operational means.  
 
A need to accommodate students and staff with disabilities to access buildings at the School has been identified. Facilities staff were previously delegated authority to execute and expend Bond Program funds for Rapid Access Program (RAP) projects in response to an individual student’s need for programmatic access. These types of projects require minor installments and adjustments to facilities to ensure a barrier-free learning environment, do not require Division of the State Architect (DSA) approval and thus can be completed “rapidly” with a budget that does not exceed $250,000. The proposed Project does not meet the parameters of the RAP due to its scope and budget. As such, the staff is presenting the proposed Project to the Board for approval.
 
The School site spans 6.77 acres and is comprised of a traditional transitional kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school and a co-located charter school program. The building area is approximately 98,900 square feet and includes five multi-story permanent buildings, five single-story permanent buildings, and six relocatable buildings. The permanent buildings were constructed between 1926 and 2011. As of the 2025-2026 Electronic Capacity Assessment Report (E-CAR), the school serves approximately 477 students and currently 117 students have been identified as having a disability.
 
The site has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level. To meet the criteria for Category Two, upgrades to one building are required including the reconfiguration of the kiln room into an accessible restroom in the administration building, and any other required improvements or mitigations to ensure compliance with local, state and/or federal facilities requirements. Construction is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2027 and be completed in the third quarter of 2027.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff have concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully complete the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Define and approve the Project and adopt the proposed amendment to the Facilities SEP to incorporate therein.  Approval will authorize staff to proceed with the implementation of the proposed Project.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond Program funds to immediately implement the proposed Project.  
 
If the Board does not approve the proposal, staff will be unable to initiate the barrier removal project which is required for compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
 
Policy Implications: 
The proposed action will advance the Los Angeles Unified 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by implementing accessibility improvements.
 
Any potential future room changes by Administrators or Principals will be reviewed by the Division of Special Education, the ADA Compliance Administrator, and the Facilities Services Division to ensure that new accessibility problems are not created as a result of the classroom moves.  This will be done in close coordination with school staff to ensure disruptions are minimized. 
 
Budget Impact: 
The total budget for the proposed Project is $432,291 and will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for ADA Transition Plan Implementation.
 
The budget was prepared based on the current information known, and assumptions about the scope, site conditions, and market conditions. The budget will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of the proposed Project.
Student Impact: 
The proposed Project will remove barriers to program accessibility for approximately 440 current and future students and qualified members of the community and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to access programs and activities at this campus.
 
Equity Impact:
Facilities staff work to coordinate Los Angeles Unified efforts under the ADA to ensure programs are accessible by students, parents, and community members with disabilities.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
Both Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 impose broad-reaching prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability.  As to facilities, a key requirement for both the ADA and Section 504 is program accessibility: programs, benefits, services, and activities provided by public entities must be accessible to people with disabilities.  This means that a qualified individual with a disability is not to be discriminated against because the entity’s facilities are inaccessible; however, this does not necessarily mean that all facilities must be accessible.  While both laws do require that newly constructed and altered facilities meet stringent accessibility requirements, they do not require that all existing facilities meet those standards, so long as the programs and services provided in those facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities.  A program or service can be made accessible by relocating it, providing it in a different manner, or utilizing some other strategy to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs and activities.  This proposed Project is in alignment with Los Angeles Unified’s implementation of the Board-approved Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan.
 
The School has been assigned a Category Two accessibility level pursuant to the Transition Plan. Staff considered the possibility of reprioritizing the schools on the Transition Plan list and proposing a more robust scope that would address all programmatic access requirements. However, it was determined that reconfiguring the kiln room in the administration building to provide an accessible restroom would provide students and staff direct access to the building. Additional accessibility improvements could be undertaken under new projects at a later date, as anticipated under the Transition Plan.
 
The Office of Environmental Health and Safety (OEHS) will evaluate the proposed Project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Body
Background: 
Projects are developed at the discretion of the Board Districts and/or Regions based upon an identified need. These projects are developed with support from Facilities Services Division staff and input from school administrators.
 
Project scopes, schedules, and budgets may vary depending on site conditions and needs. All projects must be capital in nature and adhere to bond language and laws.
 
Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations:
This item was considered by the School Construction Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee (BOC) at its meeting on December 11, 2025, as referenced in Exhibit B. The presentation that was provided is included as Exhibit C. Staff has concluded that this proposed Facilities SEP amendment is in alignment with BOC recommendations and will facilitate Los Angeles Unified’s ability to successfully implement the Facilities SEP.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Execution of these proposed projects will help improve the learning environment for students, teachers, and staff.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
Adoption of the proposed action will allow staff to execute the projects listed on Exhibit A. Failure to approve this proposed action will delay the projects and ultimately the anticipated benefit to the schools and their students.
 
Policy Implications: 
The requested actions are consistent with the Board-Prioritized Facilities Programs for BDP and RP projects and the District’s commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment. The proposed action advances Los Angeles Unified’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Pillar 4 Operational Effectiveness Modernizing Infrastructure by providing capital improvements at schools.
 
Budget Impact: 
The total combined budget for the seven proposed projects is $1,271,587. Four projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for BDP projects. Three projects are funded by Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for RP projects.
 
The new shade structure project at Hazeltine Avenue Elementary School is funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for Region Priority projects. As noted in the footnote on Exhibit A, this action requires a $200,000 transfer from the school. The Finance Division has confirmed that the school has sufficient funds reserved to support this transfer.
 
Each project budget was prepared based on the current information known and assumptions about the proposed project scope, site conditions, and market conditions. Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the planning, design, and construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each proposed project.
 
Student Impact:
The proposed projects will upgrade, modernize, and/or improve school facilities to enhance the safety and educational quality of the learning environment to benefit approximately 5,500 current and future students.
 
Equity Impact: 
Board Districts and Regions consider a number of factors, including equity, when identifying the need for BDP and RP projects.
 
Issues and Analysis: 
This report includes a number of time-sensitive, small to medium-sized projects that have been deemed critical by Board Districts and/or Regions and school administrators.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approval of the consolidation of San Fernando Middle School and San Fernando Institute of Applied Media and the closure of the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media.
end
 
Body
Background: 
San Fernando Institute for Applied Media (SFiAM) and San Fernando Middle School (SFMS) are co-located on the same campus in Board District 6 and Region North, at 130 North Brand Blvd., San Fernando, CA, 91340. 
The demographic makeup of San Fernando is predominantly Hispanic/Latino, with a vibrant blend of cultural influences shaping the community. The city's demographic composition is as follows: Hispanic (93.2%), White (4.1%), Asian (1.7%), and Black (0.9%).  Approximately 33% of students at both schools are English Only students; 34.18% are RFEP- Reclassified Fluent English Proficient; 17.38% LEP-Limited English Proficient. 
 
The City of San Fernando is characterized by its strong sense of community and close-knit neighborhoods. The City of San Fernando and community are invested in the success of local public schools.
 
During the 2023-24 school year, the District received concerns regarding safety at SFMS. As a result, the District closely reviewed the school’s systems for operations, the academic program, and overall school culture. Region North, with support from several central office divisions, provided intensive support to stabilize student safety, and ultimately determined that leadership changes were necessary. At the end of March 2024, the Principal of SFiAM (alumnus and former teacher of SFMS) became the principal of SFMS. The Assistant Principal of SFiAM became the Principal of SFiAM. 
 
In order to ensure a high-quality educational program for all students at both SFMS and SFiAM, all personnel on campus increased collaboration, including strengthening operational and instructional systems and practices for the co-located site. Effective July 2025, both schools aligned their bell schedules and began sharing personnel, including an Assistant Principal, TSP Coordinator, PSA, and Psychiatric Social Worker. Both campuses already share a Plant Manager and Cafeteria Manager. Offices were also moved to the front of the school for students, faculty, staff, parents, and community members to have convenient access.
 
Extensive stakeholder engagement has occurred to explore potential consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM for strengthened enrollment, instruction, and safety. There were several rounds of meetings with staff, students and families in May 2024, October 2024, September 2025, October 2025, and November 2025. Feedback from these groups has informed this proposed consolidation, including new instructional programs such as a re-established Dual Language Spanish program and strengthened Career and Technical Education pathways. Throughout the engagement process, both principals of SFMS and SFiAM held joint faculty, classified, and parent meetings to seek input. The administrators at SFMS and SFiAM received supportive comments from families about the consolidation and new vision for the co-located schools. 
 
The District has noticed labor partners and committed to engage in bargaining any potential effects between now and July 1, 2026.
 
Academic and Programmatic Implications:
•                     The re-established Dual Language Spanish program will provide a much-needed articulation pattern for the City of San Fernando and local community. The Dual Language Education programs at five elementary feeder schools provide content and literacy instruction in English and in Spanish. San Fernando High School’s Dual Language Education program provides grade-level content and literacy instruction in two languages, in English and the target language, Spanish. This vital middle school linkage provides students with a residential pathway to foster bilingualism and bi-literacy. Expanded elective courses will be offered in Spanish, such as robotics, mariachi and other arts.
•                     Widening of their Career and Technical Education offerings with a “Farm to Table” initiative through Horticulture and Culinary Arts pathways provides students with robust career readiness experiences. Additionally, partnering with Mission College opens up academic opportunities as well as programmatic articulation with San Fernando HS.
 
Enrollment Implications:
•                     Both schools have experienced consistent declines in enrollment since 2018-2019. Contributing factors may include local demographic changes, increased competition among educational institutions, and residual effects of the pandemic. Continued focus on academic program development, community engagement, and strategic recruitment initiatives will be essential to sustaining and potentially increasing enrollment in future years.
o                     SFMS began the 2018-2019 school year with a norm day enrollment of 732 students. Enrollment steadily decreased in each subsequent year, with current enrollment of approximately 389 students.
o                     SFiAM experienced enrollment fluctuations during the same timeframe. The school’s overall enrollment has declined from 410 students in 2018-2019 with current enrollment of approximately 354 students.
•                     Per San Fernando Middle School Zone of Choice data (from SEPPO), there were significant findings:
o                     Students are not selecting either school (SFMS or SFiAM) at high rates. 
o                     Approximately 34% of resident Zone of Choice students who are still in district schools attend other choice options outside of the area (e.g. magnet programs).
 
Expected Outcomes:
Approval of the proposed action to consolidate SFMS and SFiAM and to close SFiAM as a separate school will leverage all resources-including human capital and school funding-in direct support of a high-quality, well-rounded, safe middle school option for the City of San Fernando and surrounding communities. 
Board Options and Consequences: 
A “YES” vote approves the consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM and the closure of the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media. 
 
A “NO” vote would result in maintaining two separate schools, SFMS and SFiAM, co-located on the same campus; overall, this may impact the District's ability to align resources to fortify the educational program.
 
Policy Implications: 
This action does not change District policy.
 
Budget Impact: 
Since SFMS and SFiAM have already begun sharing personnel, an overall cost savings has been achieved. If official consolidation is approved, administrative and support positions will be carefully reviewed for potential redundancy and additional cost savings. If potential facilities improvements are requested and/or needed, Region North will need to identify additional funding sources, and work with the Facilities Services Division to scope the project. 
Student Impact:
The proposed action will provide students and families a high-quality, well-rounded, safe middle school option for the City of San Fernando and surrounding communities.
 
Equity Impact:
All students deserve access to high-quality, sustainable educational programs. By merging SFMS and SFiAM, the consolidated school will offer a more robust middle school program for students, including Dual Language Spanish, CTE, robotics, mariachi, and other elective options which will be available to all students in a safe school environment.
Issues and Analysis: 
No students will be displaced by this action. Consolidation of SFMS and SFiAM will strengthen improvement efforts for all students on this campus. The improvement of operational and instructional systems is underway, with clear improvement indicators for safety. As one school, educators-with support from the Educational Transformation Office and Region North-will develop cohesive plans, with benchmarks, to meet larger District goals and metrics.   
 
This decision is also informed by the financial and programmatic implications of declining enrollment and strategic alignment of resources. If the Board does not approve the closure of SFiAM, the two LAUSD schools, co-located on the same campus, will continue to operate separately, hindering improvement efforts.

(Approval of the Renewal Petition for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park) Recommends approval of the renewal petition for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park, a Middle performing, Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 520 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 3 and Region North, with middle level performance for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 520 students in grades TK-5 in each year of the charter term. The recommendation for approval is based on the information set forth in the attached Staff Assessment and Recommendation Report.  
end
 
Body
Background: 
N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park is a TK-5 school currently serving 415 students on a District property pursuant to a lease agreement at 21425 Cohasset Street, Canoga Park, CA, 91303 in Board District 3 and Region North. N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on May 27, 2003.  On May 1, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve up to 520 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 203-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts is a TK-5 school currently serving 394 students on four private facilities at 379 S. Loma Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; 345 S. Columbia Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; 375 S. Columbia Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90017; and 303 S. Loma Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90017 in Board District 2 and Region East. N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on December 10, 2002.  On May 1, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 450 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current N.E.W. Academy of Science and Arts governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 204-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Body
Background: 
Aspire Titan Academy is a TK-5 school currently serving 323 students on a private facility at 6720 S. Alameda Street, Huntington Park, CA, 90255 in Board District 5 and Region East.  Aspire Titan Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on January 15, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 330 students in grades TK-5. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Aspire Titan Academy expires June 30, 2026.

Action Proposed: 
Approve the renewal petition for Goethe International Charter (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 4 and Region West, with high level performance for six (6) years, beginning July 1, 2026 until June 30, 2032, to serve up to 775 students in grades TK-8 in each year of the charter term.

Body
Background: 
Goethe International Charter is a TK-8 span school currently serving 525 students on a District Proposition 39 Co-location site at 12500 Braddock Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90066 in Board District 4 and Region West. Goethe International Charter was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on July 8, 2008.  On January 9, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 455 students in grades TK-5. On June 5, 2018, the Board of Education approved a request for material revision to increase enrollment up to 775 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Goethe International Charter expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, Goethe International Charter submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Goethe International Charter’s governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Expected Outcomes:
Charter School is expected to operate its school in a manner consistent with Board action, policies and requirements, local, state, and federal law including ordinances, statutes, and regulations as well as with the terms and conditions set forth in Charter School’s petition. The measurable pupil outcomes and method by which pupil progress toward outcomes will be measured are set forth in the charter petition.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of approval of the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operations as a charter school for the charter term beginning July 1, 2026.  
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of approval, and instead takes specific action to deny the renewal charter petition, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operations as a charter school. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education.  If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 202-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases. Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements. 
 
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for charter school approval.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Recommendation
Action Proposed:

Body
Background: 
Port of Los Angeles High is a 9-12 school currently serving 923 students on a private facility at 250 West 5th Street, San Pedro, CA, 90731 in Board District 7 and Region South. Port of Los Angeles High was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February 11, 2003.  On April 3, 2018, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 1,000 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for Port of Los Angeles High expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, Port of Los Angeles High submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 16, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has met the requirements for renewal and therefore recommends approval of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current Port of Los Angeles High governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:

Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).

This Board Report No. 207-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.

Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for New Horizons Charter Academy (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 6 and Region North, with middle level performance and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy.

Body
Background: 
New Horizons Charter Academy is a TK-8 span school currently serving 132 students on a District campus at 6501 Fair Ave, North Hollywood, CA, 91601 in Board District 6 and Region North. New Horizons Charter Academy was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on April 16, 2013.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 300 students in grades TK-8. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Horizons Charter Academy expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, New Horizons Charter Academy submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025.
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.

Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for New Horizons Charter Academy and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that (1) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the renewal petition due to substantial fiscal and governance factors; and (2) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the renewal petition.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 205-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Horizons Charter Academy, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language.
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
Charter School has selected to join the LAUSD SELPA Option 3. Charter School’s fair share contribution to special education will be 10% of the charter school’s AB 602 (rate includes Base, Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), and Growth/Decline reduced by the amount withheld for Program Specialist/Regionalized Services) and Federal IDEA revenues. This amount will be paid from Charter School’s Local Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) funds or other unrestricted revenue sources and will be allocated to support the existing District-wide administration of special education supports and services. The amount withheld by the District from the Program Specialist/Regionalized Services in fiscal year will continue to be withheld and adjusted annually for COLA. An additional 10% of special education revenues will be retained by the District and allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3, with the leadership of the Director, Charter Operated Programs. These funds will be used to support the personnel for the members of the LAUSD SELPA Option 3; build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities; and, to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools. If Charter School does not spend their allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced in an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year. 
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources. 
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in a MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.
 
Equity Impact:
Not applicable
 
 
 
Issues and Analysis: 
If all applicable pending issues, including but not limited to special education requirements, special education local planning area (SELPA) requirements, governance, fiscal and facilities matters, are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting, the item may be pulled from the agenda to the extent consistent with the Charter Schools Act and the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools.

Brief Description:
description
(Denial of the Renewal Petition for New Millennium Secondary) Recommends denial of the renewal petition for New Millennium Secondary, a Middle performing, Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 7 and Region South, for five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2026, until June 30, 2031, to serve up to 225 students in grades 9-12 in each year of the charter term.  
end
 
Recommendation
Action Proposed: 
Adopt the denial of the renewal petition for New Millennium Secondary (“Charter School”), a Start-Up Independent charter school, located in Board District 7 and Region South, with middle level performance and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary.
end
 
Body
Background: 
New Millennium Secondary is a 9-12 school currently serving 96 students on a District campus at 182nd Street, Gardena, CA, 90248 in Board District 7 and Region South. New Millennium Secondary was originally approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on June 10, 2008.  On November 7, 2017, the charter school was renewed for a five-year term to serve 225 students in grades 9-12. Pursuant to Education Code section 47607.4, all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2025, inclusive, shall have their term extended by two years, and all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027, inclusive, shall have their term extended by one additional year. Thus, by operation of law, the charter term for New Millennium Secondary expires June 30, 2026.
 
On September 19, 2025, New Millennium Secondary submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking to continue operations of its independent charter school. The 90-day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December 18, 2025. 
 
An initial Public Hearing was held on November 17, 2025.
 
Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application and its record of performance, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements set forth in Education Code sections 47605, 47607 and 47607.2 and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition. 
 
Due Diligence:
Current New Millennium Secondary governing board members completed questionnaires so the District may assess whether any conflicts of interest arise based on the information provided. A confidential due diligence review of the charter school and its governing organization, school leader and financial manager, was performed by the Office of the Inspector General, and to the extent any material concerns were identified by the Office of the Inspector General, such information was forwarded to District staff for further assessment.
 
Statutory Framework and Criteria for Renewal:
A charter school must demonstrate that it is eligible for a renewal of its charter by meeting specific renewal criteria outlined in the Charter Schools Act. The renewal criteria prescribed in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 requires a three-pronged analysis:
 
Criterion 1: The Charter Schools Act provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in Education Code section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. The first criterion considered in reviewing a renewal petition requires an analysis of the following:
 
•                     Whether the petition includes a sound educational program;
•                     Whether the petition contains a reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 elements required for petitions;
•                     Whether the petition contains an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code section 47605(e); and
•                     Whether the charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. Education Code section 47607(b) provides that renewals are governed by the standards and criteria described in section 47605 applicable to initial petitions. (The Board may not consider the community impact analysis or District fiscal analysis in determining whether to grant or deny a renewal petition).
 
Criterion 2: The Board is required to consider the charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators. Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 prescribe three-tiers of performance classification in which a charter school falls within one of the following categories - “high,” “middle,” or “low.” The three-tier classification considers a charter school’s performance on the California School Dashboard accountability indicators, with an emphasis on the measurements of academic performance.
                     
Criterion 3: Notwithstanding Criterion 1 and 2, the Board must also consider whether the charter school’s enrollment or dismissal practices are discriminatory as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).) Additionally, the Board considers whether the charter school has substantial fiscal or governance factors as grounds for nonrenewal. (Ed. Code, § 47607(e).)
 
Grounds for Nonrenewal:
Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the renewal charter petition application for New Millennium Secondary and have assessed that the renewal petition application does not meet the criteria for approval.  As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, based on review of the petition and supporting documentation, staff has determined that (1) as a Middle Performing charter school, Charter School fails to meet or make sufficient progress toward meeting standards that provide a benefit to the pupils of the school; that closure of Charter School is in the best interest of pupils, and this decision to recommend denial provided greater weight to performance on measurements of academic performance; and (2) petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the renewal petition.
 
 
Expected Outcomes:
Denial will prevent Charter School from continuing its operations as a charter school under the authority of the LAUSD Board. 
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
“Yes” - If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, Charter School would not be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the authority of the LAUSD Board. Charter School’s current charter expires on June 30, 2026. The petitioners may appeal a denial to Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the petition is approved on appeal by the Los Angeles County Board of Education, Charter School would be authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Education. If the Los Angeles County Board of Education denies the renewal petition, the petitioners may appeal that denial to the California State Board of Education. If the denial of the renewal petition is reversed by the California State Board of Education, the California State Board of Education shall designate, in consultation with the petitioners, either the LAUSD Board or the Los Angeles County Board of Education as the chartering authority. This Board Report No. 206-25/26, accompanying documents, and transcript of the Board meeting, shall constitute the Board of Education’s adopted written findings of fact for the denial of Charter School renewal petition. 
 
“No” - If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Renewal Charter Petition for New Millennium Secondary, and instead takes specific action to approve the renewal charter petition, Charter School would be authorized to continue operating as a charter school under the terms of the approved renewal petition for a five (5) year period beginning July 1, 2026. Within 30 days, the Board requires that the school submit to the Charter Schools Division a revised renewal charter petition that is consistent with and meets all applicable legal and LAUSD requirements, including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all fifteen required elements and current Federal, State, District Required Language. 
 
Policy Implications: 
All provisions in the FSDRL shall be consistent with and be governed by all applicable legal and District policy requirements. To the extent any inconsistency may exist between any provision contained in the FSDRL and any applicable legal and District policy requirement, those applicable legal and District policy requirements shall control and the FSDRL shall be updated accordingly.
 
Budget Impact: 
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school, and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases. If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition, the action will not have a budget impact. If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved, the impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (Option 1, 2, or 3) executed by the charter school and the District, if applicable.
 
Under Education Code section 47604(d), a chartering authority that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated as or by a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not liable for the debts or obligations of the charter school or for claims arising from the performance of acts, errors, or omissions by the charter school, if the chartering authority has complied with all oversight responsibilities required by law including, but not limited to, those required by Education Code section 47604.32 and Education Code section 47605(m). As the chartering authority, the District will continue to monitor and evaluate the charter school’s fiscal condition and operations, and management of public funds, including review of all legally required fiscal reports, and the annual update of the charter school’s LCAP. (Ed. Code, §§ 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5.) Any significant modifications to the charter school’s charter or operations that raise financial implications would require a material revision prior to implementation. Charter schools are expected to secure and maintain all insurance coverage consistent with all applicable legal, District and charter requirements.
 
Charter School has selected LAUSD SELPA Option 2. Charter School’s fair share contribution for special education will be 20% of the District’s general fund contribution rate per Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period, which will be paid from Charter School’s LCFF funds or other unrestricted revenue sources. This formula will increase by 5% for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches 35%.  For the remainder of the term of Charter School’s charter, the rate will remain at 35% of the District’s general fund contribution rate for each fiscal year. If Charter School is renewing its charter petition and has reached the 35% fair share contribution rate for special education, Charter School shall continue to contribute at the 35% rate for the full renewal period. If Charter School is renewing and has reached a fair share contribution rate that is less than 35%, Charter School’s fair share contribution rate shall continue to increase by 5% per year from the prior year’s rate until the applicable percentage reaches 35%. If Charter School does not spend its allocation of special education funds during a fiscal year of the charter petition period, the allocation of special education funds to Charter School for the next fiscal year will be reduced by an amount equal to the unspent special education funds of the previous fiscal year.
 
In addition to the payments required under this option, Charter School may request specific special education related services from the District through fee-for-service arrangements that will reflect the calculated cost of the requested services and will be contingent on the District’s available resources.
 
Any change in the Option election that occurs during Charter School’s charter term shall be mutually agreed upon and addressed in an MOU between the charter school and the District. The new Option election shall be effective on July 1 of the next school year with the corresponding fair share contribution.
 
Student Impact:
As stated in the LAUSD Policy and Procedures for Charter Schools, “[W]hen the LAUSD Board authorizes and oversees a charter school, it establishes a relationship to advance its vision and mission and to accelerate gains in academic achievement and accountability for all of its students and public schools,” (Policy, p.3).  Based on a comprehensive review and assessment of Charter School’s renewal petition application, staff has determined that Charter School has not met the requirements for charter school approval and therefore recommends denial of the renewal petition.

description
Whereas, For the 2024-25 school year the Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over 64,000 students receiving special education services, 33 percent of which have moderate-to-severe disabilities; 
 
Whereas, As the overall District enrollment declines, the share of students with disabilities has increased over the past two decades from 11.5 percent of the total student population in 2002-03 school year to approximately 16 percent in the 2025-26 school year; 
 
Whereas, The District provides 38 types of services and supports to students with disabilities in order to provide a free appropriate public education; 
 
Whereas, The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 (IDEA) by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states, local school districts, and taxpayers to pay for needed services, and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall, 
 
Whereas, In the 2025-2026 school year, the District plans to spend over $2 billion in special education costs, with the District’s federal IDEA funding falling woefully short of Congress’ commitment upon IDEA’s passage to 40 percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities; 
 
Whereas, The grossly inadequate level of funding for special education at both the federal and state level also does not sufficiently differentiate funding based on the severity of the student’s disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to fully meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities; 
 
Whereas, In 2021 the State established the Special Education Early Intervention Preschool Grant to provide early intervention services and supports to preschool-aged children with special needs who are at risk of falling significantly behind;
 
Whereas, The majority of the current state funding structure for special education is based on student attendance (AB 602) providing Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) funding based on their overall student attendance, regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide; 
 
Whereas, The District proudly operates 13 Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual student’s unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school; 
 
Whereas, Under a new proposal the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services instead of the U.S. Department of Education would assume responsibility for administering federally funded special education programs including the IDEA, raising serious concerns because the shift threatens to undermine critical oversight, accountability, and protections for students with disabilities; and 
 
Whereas, Special education services are further threatened by proposed reductions to medicaid, upon which many school districts depend to fund therapies, medical supports, services for students with disabilities. These cuts would disproportionately harm students with significant special needs and undermine their right to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE); now, therefore, be it 
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families, particularly in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with disabilities; 
 
Resolved Further, That the District formally recognizes December 2 as National Special Education Day this year and every year and encourages all schools, students, and families to celebrate our children with disabilities and the unique assets they contribute to our school communities;

Whereas, National Mentoring Month 2026 will be celebrated from January 1 through January 31 to highlight the essential role mentoring plays in supporting academic achievement, social-emotional development, and long-term success for young people; 
 
Whereas, National Mentoring Month recognizes the invaluable contributions of mentors and raises awareness of how positive mentoring relationships strengthen students, families, schools, and communities; 
 
Whereas, Mentoring fosters positive life and social skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achievement and college access, supports career exploration, and nurtures youth leadership development;
 
Whereas, Research shows that youth with mentors are 92 percent more likely to volunteer regularly in their communities, 75 percent more likely to hold leadership positions in clubs or sports teams, 22 percent more likely to feel a strong sense of belonging during their upbringing, and 58 percent credit their mentor with supporting their mental health; 
 
Whereas, Mentoring demonstrates long-term effectiveness, with 74 percent of individuals who had a meaningful mentor reporting that their mentor significantly contributed to later life success, 85 percent saying their mentor helped them with school-related challenges, and nearly 60 percent of individuals under 40 continuing to draw advice from their childhood mentors; 
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes mentoring as a powerful tool for promoting educational equity, fostering resilience, closing opportunity gaps, and supporting the social and emotional well-being of all students; 
 
Whereas, The Beyond the Bell program provides enriching before- and after-school opportunities where students receive academic guidance, leadership development, and supportive relationships that often grow into meaningful mentoring connections;

Whereas, The Foster Youth Achievement Program provides specialized support, advocacy, and mentorship to students in foster care, ensuring they receive the individualized guidance and stability needed to overcome systemic barriers and thrive academically and emotionally; 
 
Whereas, Federal budget proposals for fiscal year 2026 would eliminate funding for GEAR UP, among other student aid and mentoring/college-access programs;
 
Whereas, The District recognizes that reductions in federal funding for mentoring and access programs would disproportionately affect students who benefit most from those services and undermine long-term equity and opportunity goals; and
 
Whereas, The District maintains strong partnerships with universities, nonprofit organizations, community-based agencies, and civic groups to expand mentoring opportunities across the District and ensure that all students have access to trusted, supportive role models; now, therefore, be it

Ms. Newbill - Celebration of Black History Month 2026 (Res-031-25/26) (Noticed December 16, 2025)
Body
 
description
Whereas, Black History Month, or National African American History Month, is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history; 
 
Whereas, Black History Month 2026 is a celebration of the 100-year legacy of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, whose establishment of Negro History Week in 1926 laid the foundation for what would become Black History Month, a cornerstone of historical education and cultural reflection in the United States; 
 
Whereas, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice; 
 
Whereas, Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history; 
 
Whereas, Established by Dr. Carter G. Woodson in 1915, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) strives to promote, research, preserve, interpret, and disseminate information about Black life, history, and culture to the global community. 
 
Whereas, Black History Month 2026 marks the centennial celebration of organized efforts to recognize, preserve, and honor the history, culture, and achievements of Black Americans, reflected in the 2026 ASALH theme, “A Century of Black History Commemorations”; 
 
Whereas, For a century, Black History commemorations have illuminated the resilience, innovation, leadership, and contributions of Black Americans in fields such as education, science, the arts, business, civil rights, government, technology, and public service; 
 
Whereas, For the past century, spanning major milestones such as the Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights Movement, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and continuing through the cultural, political, and educational advancements of the 21st century, Black History commemorations have played a vital role in elevating Black voices, honoring Black achievements, and deepening America’s understanding of its own history;
 
Whereas, The centennial theme honors the work of generations of educators, scholars, activists, students, and community organizations who have advanced the study and preservation of Black history, ensuring that the richness of Black experiences is included in the national narrative; 
 
Whereas, Black History Month serves as an essential opportunity to uplift stories that have historically been overlooked or underrepresented, fostering a deeper understanding of the shaping of American democracy, culture, and identity; 
 
Whereas, Recognizing this centennial milestone reinforces the importance of continuing to expand culturally responsive education, support inclusive curriculum, and ensure that all students learn about and appreciate the diverse histories that enrich our society; 
 
Whereas, The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to culturally responsive, inclusive, and historically accurate instruction that reflects the diversity of its students and honors the contributions of Black Americans; 
 
Whereas, The Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP) provides targeted academic, social-emotional, and community support to address opportunity gaps, promote equity, and improve outcomes for Black students across the District; 
 
Whereas, The District has strengthened its African American History and Ethnic Studies curriculum, ensuring students have access to comprehensive instruction on African civilizations, the African diaspora, the struggle for civil rights, and the ongoing pursuit of justice and empowerment for historically marginalized communities, encouraging students to think critically about social justice, civic engagement, and shared responsibility; 
 
Whereas, Black History Month serves as a reaffirmation of the District’s commitment to anti-racism, educational equity, and the creation of learning environments where every student feels seen, valued, and empowered;
 
Whereas, Honoring a century of Black history commemorations underscores the importance of ensuring that future generations continue to learn about the diverse, complex, and foundational contributions of Black Americans from 1926 to 2026 and beyond while recognizing the ongoing work necessary to protect civil rights, expand educational opportunity, and advance justice and equity for all students; and
 
Whereas, Our democracy’s founding ideals were exclusionary when they were written, but Black Americans have continuously fought to make them true; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month;
 
Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black Culture, Black Inventors, Black Artists, Black Artisans, Black Advocacy Black Leaders, Black Civic Engagement, and Black workers; 
 
Resolved, further, That the Board commits to the inclusion of Black History into the core curriculum, including, but not limited to Ethnic Studies, African American History, and African American Literature, as well as encourages strong integration across coursework in History, English Language Arts, Science, Mathematics, and Arts so that this critical learning lives in the minds of our students beyond the month of February;
 
Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to expand upon the District's existing efforts, such as the Black Student Achievement Plan, to continue to identify strategies and tactics to align resources targeted toward eliminating anti-racist educational practices and closing the gap of academic achievement outcomes for Black Students;
 
Resolved further, That the District will continue to address challenges unique to Black students and families and recognize the Black Lives Matter at Schools Week of Action (February 2-6, 2026).  This national week of action includes a variety of activities focused on social justice in education, such as curriculum fairs, community-building events, and workshops designed to support and empower Black students, families and educators; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the Superintendent will work with educators, librarians, all the schools of the District, and our wider community to recognize and celebrate this month, and throughout the academic year, with culturally relevant and appropriate curriculum, programs, ceremonies, and activities that generate in-depth discussion of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans.",,,,,,,,

Body
 
description
Whereas, Congress established the U.S. Department of Education to ensure focused, expert, and coordinated federal support for the nation’s public schools and students, and to uphold a national commitment to equitable, high-quality education for all; 
 
Whereas, Federal law clearly grants Congress alone the authority to alter the functions and responsibilities of the Department of Education; 
 
Whereas, For decades the Department has played an essential role in ensuring that all students, particularly those historically underserved including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, students in foster care, and others receive the services, protections, and educational opportunities to which they are legally entitled; 
 
Whereas, The current administration announced this week its intention to unlawfully transfer numerous critical functions and offices of the Department of Education to other federal agencies, actions that would create widespread confusion, undermine congressional authority, and destabilize the nation’s education system; 
 
Whereas, Earlier this year, the illegal transfer of the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education to the Department of Labor (DOL) resulted in significant operational failures, including delayed guidance, disrupted training, and impeded access to funding for states and school districts demonstrating that such agencies lack the expertise, infrastructure, and capacity to administer education programs; 
 
Whereas, Shifting additional programs to DOL, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of State would multiply bureaucratic barriers, reduce oversight, and force states, districts, families, and students to navigate unfamiliar agencies with no experience administering K-12 or higher education programs; 
 
Whereas, Moving core functions of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education-including management of Title I-to DOL is especially nonsensical and would erode critical oversight of annual assessments, school accountability, literacy initiatives, family engagement programs, charter and community school support, and services for migrant and homeless students, among others; 
 
Whereas, DOL enforcement offices such as OSHA and the Wage and Hour Division are structured for workplace regulatory compliance, not for continuous improvement or partnership with state education agencies, and are therefore wholly unsuited to performing federal education duties; 
 
Whereas, Public polling consistently shows that nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults oppose eliminating or weakening the Department of Education, demonstrating widespread recognition of the harm such actions would cause to students and public schools; 
 
Whereas, Anticipated future transfers of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) are deeply alarming, particularly given by OCR’s recent dismissal of thousands of civil rights cases, leaving millions of students without remedies to enforce their federally protected rights; 
 
Whereas, As the nation marks the 50th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), any attempt to transfer special education oversight to HHS represents a profound step backward, threatening to re-segregate and marginalize students with disabilities and diminish decades of progress; and
 
Whereas, These actions will distance students from the federal protections, resources, and support systems they rely upon, and the agencies designated to assume these responsibilities lack the relationships, expertise, and staffing required to fulfill them; now, therefore, be it
 
Resolved, That the Los Angeles Unified School District strongly condemn and oppose the administration’s unlawful and irresponsible transfer of authority from the Department of Education to other federal agencies; 
 
Resolved further, That the District opposes the firing of hundreds of workers within OSERS which oversees states’ compliance with IDEA;
 
Resolved further, That District opposes the administration’s actions towards the Department of Education’s actions towards the Office of Civil Rights, which has abandoned its mission to uphold the rights of all students, especially those who are from traditionally marginalized communities;
 
 
Resolved further, That we call upon Congress to immediately reassert its constitutional authority, halt these unprecedented and legally dubious actions, and protect the integrity and mission of the U.S. Department of Education; and, be it finally
 
Resolved, That the District affirms our unwavering commitment to safeguarding the rights, opportunities, and educational futures of all students, and to ensuring that federal education policy remains grounded in equity, expertise, and the rule of law.",,,,,,,,

(2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and Multi-Year Projections) Recommends approval of the 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and Multi-Year Projections and its submission to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).
end
 
Recommendation
Actions Proposed: 
1.                     Approve the 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report, which contains a “positive” certification (enclosed herewith as “Attachment A”). In addition, authorize the submittal of the First Interim Financial Report to the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (CSS).
2.                     Adopt a Resolution authorizing the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund in Fiscal Year 2027-28 (enclosed herewith as “Attachment B”). 
end
 
Body
Background: 
Under Education Code Sections 35035(i), 42130, and 42131, District staff must prepare and submit interim financial reports to the governing board at intervals throughout the fiscal year.  As part of the interim financial reports, the Board of Education (Board) certifies to the County Superintendent of Schools, the State Controller, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction whether the District is able to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the current fiscal year and the next two fiscal years, using one of three certification scenarios:
 
•                     A positive certification indicates that based on current projections, the District will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and two subsequent years.
•                     A qualified certification indicates that the District may not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or two subsequent fiscal years.
•                     A negative certification indicates that the District will not be able to meet its financial obligations for the current or subsequent fiscal year.
 
Expected Outcomes:
Upon approval by the Board, the District will file the First Interim Financial Report with the County Superintendent of Schools (CSS) and be in compliance with Education Code requirements.
 
Board Options and Consequences: 
The Board may accept the staff’s determination of a positive certification or approve the report with a modification of the revenue and expenditure projections.
 
CSS shall review the District’s certification. It has the authority and responsibility to change the certification if it determines that the District’s certification was not appropriate.  
 
In the event the District’s certification is other than positive at the first interim period, it must submit a proposal to the CSS that addresses the District’s fiscal conditions (“fiscal recovery plan”).  In addition, it may not, in that fiscal year or the next fiscal year, issue non-voter approved debt unless the CSS determines that the District shall probably make repayment of such debt issuance. Moreover, the CSS may also impose various restrictions on districts that fail to deal with financial issues raised in interim reports. Finally, rating agencies may consider interim reports when evaluating or revising credit ratings.
 
The Board may elect not to authorize the balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund Other Than for Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund, thereby requiring other balancing solutions to maintain positive balances in the multi-year projection period.
 
Policy Implications: 
Board approval and submission of the District’s 2025-26 First Interim Financial Report and ensures compliance with the Education Code and LACOE requirements. Furthermore, the authorization and balance transfer from Fund 17 Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects to the General Fund shall improve the District’s financial condition.
 
Budget Impact: 
This report maintains reserves at the required statutory level.
 
Student Impact:
Compliance with Education Code requirements ensures that the District shall continue to operate and serve its student population.
 
Equity Impact:

Score

Score Rationale



Recognition

Resource prioritization varies from a district-wide perspective to a targeted student population based on student need and its impact on student achievement.



Results

description
Whereas, In October 2025, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency through a “Proclamation of Local Emergency for Federal Immigration Actions” in order to provide those most impacted with resources including economic relief, eviction protections, and other assistance; and in December 2024, LA City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance in to prohibit the use of city resources, personnel, property and data for federal immigration enforcement;
 
Whereas, Since the beginning of 2025, in Los Angeles and across the region, communities have witnessed heightened attacks on our most vulnerable communities, including Black, LGBTQ+, and immigrants, as a result of policies and rhetoric enacted by the federal administration; 
 
Whereas, As a result of those heightened attacks, Los Angeles Unified School District students and family members have been targeted, arrested, detained, and deported to their home countries within a matter of days;
 
Whereas, Communities are experiencing a widespread fear of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, detentions, and deportations near and around our schools consequently creating chaos and economic uncertainty as a result of family separations, job loss, housing destabilization, and movement across the region; 
 
Whereas, Recent immigration enforcement efforts have created fear, sorrow, and anxiety in our communities negatively impacting the mental health of young people. According to the 2025 BlueSky Youth Mental Health Survey, over 81 percent of youth respondents expressed concern with discrimination against immigrants;
 
Whereas, Particular communities across the greater Los Angeles region are being racially profiled and targeted. The map “Areas of Focus for Immigration Activity” produced by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) highlighted the communities of the San Fernando Valley (Pacoima and North Hills), South LA (Jefferson Park and Westmont), and Southeast LA (Norwalk, Bellflower, Downey, South Gate) as the communities with the highest immigration enforcement activity between June 6 and July 20, 2025;
 
Whereas, The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has reaffirmed its commitment to making Los Angeles Unified School District a sanctuary district through resolutions  “Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-093- 16/17), and “Reaffirm that Los Angeles Unified School District Will Be a Sanctuary District and Safe Zone for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement” (Res-034-24/25); 
 
Whereas, In July of 2025, the Board unanimously approved the resolution “Upholding Our Constitutional Rights and Standing with Immigrant Communities” (Res-086-24/25) which condemns the militarization of immigrant communities, including any uninvited deployment of federal agents, National Guard personnel, in our schools and communities without local request and transparent civilian oversight;
 
Whereas, The District has responded by expanding the We Are One campaign, which includes regular Know Your Rights trainings, emergency preparedness plans, educating individuals of their civil rights when interacting with immigration enforcement officers, strengthening partnerships with community organizations and service providers, establishing and implementing protocols for when ICE attempts to enter our campuses, and other mental, financial and legal supports for impacted students and families;
 
Whereas, Community members, organizations and labor partners in the greater Los Angeles area have organized rapid response and mutual aid networks; organized and led Know Your Rights trainings for community members, students, and educators; documented ICE raids that have provided the basis for lawsuits against the federal administration; demonstrated a commitment to keeping our students safe by being present at schools during the first week of school; and communicating with board members and other District leaders to offer support;
 
Whereas, Through the unanimously approved “Community-Based Safety Analysis and Expansion” (Res-023-22/23) resolution, the District committed to implementing a holistic vision of school safety that called for a Community-Based Safety Pilot at Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP) schools incorporating safe passages, peacebuilding, and community development; and a Landscape Analysis Report produced by the Independent Analysis Unit to inform the expansion of community-based safety programs across the District;
 
Whereas, Community-Bbased Ssafety programs, when implemented with fidelity and accountability, can help to create inclusive, supportive, and safe learning environments for Black, undocumented immigrant, LGBTQ+ students without criminalizing or harming students; 
 
Whereas, The District allocated $125 million in base funding and an additional $50 million in one-time funding in the 2025-26 budget towards BSAP, which included funding to maintain and expand community-based safety program at BSAP schools;
 
Whereas, The District currently has over 170 active community-based safety programs, which include;: more than 75 safe passage programs, approximately 60 peace building programs, and nearly 40 community development programs across BSAP schools; and
 
Whereas, The District has recently executed separate Memorandaum of Understandings (MOU) with the Los County Office of Violence Prevention and the City of Los Angeles’s Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program (GRYD), leading to the initiation of a pilot safe passage program at Sotomayor Arts and Sciences Magnet, Bernstein High School and Virgil Middle School; now, therefore be it
 
Resolved, That in an effort to work towards creating a greater sense of safety on the route to and from school for students and families, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recommits to the model of Community-Based Safety, which includes safe passage, peacebuilding and community development programs;
 
Resolved further, That the Los Angeles Unified School District will utilize a community-based safety approach to its preparation and response related to neighborhood immigration enforcement through efforts that include:
•                     Expanding trainings for staff, students, and families on ICE protocols, Know Your Rights, de-escalation skill building, restorative justice, and peacebuilding, and potentially through the Every School Safe modules,
•                     Providing tailored guidance and training to school leadership teams on updating safety plans, practicing drills, and assessing campus facility security,
