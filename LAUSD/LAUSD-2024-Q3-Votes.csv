Hallinger, 2003; Leithwood,  Louis,  Anderson  & Wahlstrom,  2004, Robinson 2007) consistently shows that the principal’s instructional leadership role  has a strong influence on learner performance and asserts that learner performance is likely to be greater where there is direct principal leadership involvement in planning  and professional  development;Whereas, The UCLA Center for Transformation of Schools has identified obstacles to retaining Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) teachers and recommends that administrators and schools make a strong, lasting commitment to “the ideals and policies that best support students in cultivating critical awareness” and that “the use of standardized tests should be dramatically reduced and supplemented with more authentic and relevant performance assessment”;Whereas, Performance assessment aligns with community-based learning because it enables students to demonstrate their learning in authentic ways and apply their knowledge and skills to new contexts by creating products, presentations and/or demonstrations that reflect understanding and mastery; andWhereas, Hiring Community School Lead Teachers who rely on performance assessment versus student preparation for standardized testing will allow Community Schools to better support all five pillars of LAUSD’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan (Academic Excellence, Joy and Wellness, Engagement and Collaboration, Operational Effectiveness, and Investing in Staff);

Once established, SMTLI schools will be excused from standardized testing with the exception of state-and federally-mandated assessments; and, be it finallyResolved, That District staff, and labor and other partners will form a team in the second semester of school year 24-25 to develop the operational aspects for how this initiative is to be implemented, and communicated across the systems and structures of the CSI, and to create an application and rubric for approval so that this new initiative can commence on July 1, 2025.",FileMaker Resolutions DB,2024-08-13,Jackie Goldberg,Rocio Rivas; Kelly Gonez; Scott Schmerelson,,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes
