    "title": "Ensuring Local School Site and Community Control, Authority, Autonomy and Choice Regarding Safe Campuses and the Protection of Our Students and Staff (Res-029-20/21)",
    "language": "Whereas, In May 2018, the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District entered into a three-year employment contract with Mr. Austin Beutner to serve as Superintendent of Schools for the Los Angeles Unified School District;Whereas, The hallmark characteristic of Superintendent Beutner's leadership and reorganization plan and policies, enthusiastically supported by a majority of the Board and numerous local non-profit organizations, has been the decentralization of resources and decision making in order for each school site and school community to be able to assess the unique needs and priorities of their students, families, local neighborhoods, and community partners;Whereas, In an April 21, 2021 letter to the Board declining an extension of his contract, Mr. Beutner stated that with the support of the Board and that of many partners in labor, government, industry, the community and the homes of each family and every student, we have \"(t)ransformed Los Angeles Unified from a top-down, one-size-fits-all bureaucracy into 44 nimble local teams, each dedicated  to the community it serves\" and unequivocally asserted that community schools unite families, educators, and community partners to provide all students with quality instruction, enrichment activities, physical and mental health services and social-emotional supports which create the opportunity for children to succeed in school and in life;Whereas, As the largest authorizer of charter schools in the nation, the District has long been considered a major proponent of allowing parents and families to choose  or be assigned to publicly funded schools that are independent, autonomous and not bound by centrally generated policies and practices that their local school community may not support, thus allowing families who live in the attendance areas for independent charter high schools such Granada Hills, Pacific Palisades, Birmingham, and El Camino Real to assess the needs of their schools and local communities, freely discuss options, and make decisions concerning critical issues such as school climate, health, safety and protecting students and staff - discussions and decisions not currently available to neighboring affiliated charter high schools such as Sylmar, Taft, Cleveland, and Reseda;Whereas, Public opinion research on school safety involving over 44,000 students, parents and school staff was conducted in October, 2020.  Survey results showed a broad range of opinions about what public safety measures respondents preferred or made them feel most comfortable including key findings that, across the demographic subgroups surveyed, perceptions of the Los Angeles School Police Department were largely positive, and among parents and staff there was significant opposition to reducing the presence of school police;Whereas, Attitudes toward school policing are likely viewed through the lens of perceived levels of campus safety and perceptions of school police, including the following:\u00b7\tThe broadly held view that campuses are generally safe before, during, and afterschool;\u00b7\tHigh degrees of consensus that school police are engaged in emergency response activities and protecting campus perimeters, but less certainty around other areas of engagement; and\u00b7\tLess familiarity with segments of the community that may be negatively impacted by school policing;Whereas, In the 2019-20 school year, out of 115,000 services calls, there were only 10 total complaints against school police from staff, parents or students;Whereas, Each school site is responsible for developing a comprehensive safety plan based on the needs of the campus climate, which is reflective in the cornerstone value of the Community Schools model of local autonomy and decision making, yet school-based administrators have expressed profound unreadiness and a lack of empowerment as it relates to accessing all available resources to aid in optimizing school safety for their campuses in a way that aligns with the true spirit of local control; andWhereas, The Board and District staff - understanding that the District covers an area totaling 710 square miles, including most of the city of Los Angeles and all or portions of 26 cities and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County - are currently engaged in profound discussions about the need for equitable resource allocation based on the recognition that school communities have different needs based on unequal and different opportunities, resources and experiences; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the students, parents and staff who constitute the different and diverse school communities throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District be granted the authority and flexibility to discuss, determine and decide on the measures they believe will improve and maintain positive school climate and safety on their school campuses; and be it finally Resolved, That the Superintendent direct staff to implement the School Police Request Assessment process developed by the Office of School Climate and Culture or develop a new safety assessment plan to be completed within 30 days.",

    "language": "Whereas, There has been a significant rise in hate crimes here in Los Angeles and across the country over the last four years against many racial, ethnic, religious, and other minority groups, and LAUSD has a long history of centering the positive contributions of the Black, Latinx, Asian American and Pacific Islander, women, LGBTQ+, and other communities;Whereas, This discrimination, racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism has not only generated heated rhetoric but has resulted in harassment, vandalism, physical assaults, and worse, and no individual or group within our District should fear becoming targets of retaliation, derision, bullying, isolation, or violence;Whereas, Students who identify as Jewish come from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, including those with overlapping racial and ethnic identities, and attend schools in all six Local Districts, and Los Angeles is home to the third largest Jewish population in the world behind Israel and New York, and approximately 15 percent of the K-12 child population within LAUSD\u2019s boundaries are themselves or have family members who are Jewish;Whereas, What we teach our youth about their ancestral legacies and cultures is essential in the fight for racial and ethnic justice and equity, and the promise of full inclusion and desegregation in LAUSD or public schools has not yet been realized;Whereas, LAUSD publishes policy bulletins and memoranda on an annual basis affirming the value and dignity of all racial, ethnic, and religious groups, including MEM-5466: Calendar of Commemorative Dates and Observances, and offers the opportunity for Jewish students and staff to observe the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur with unassigned days in the school calendar;Whereas, Property and vandalism crimes against Jewish temples and places of worship and physical assaults against people who \u201clook Jewish\u201d or dine at restaurants frequented by Jewish people has increased significantly over the past four years and most recently due to the escalation of the conflict and military action in Israel, Gaza, and in the Middle East, and was denounced by President Biden and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, the City Council, and faith leaders from across the Los Angeles region;Whereas, Reports of white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, and anti-Israel graffiti, bullying, harassment, and violence on LAUSD campuses has been on the rise for the past four years, and administrators, teachers, and student leaders need updated and readily available training and resources to prevent and address anti-Semitism in all its forms;Whereas, The social content of instructional materials used in California public schools must comply with California Education Code section 60040-60045 and 60048 as well as the State Board of Education guidelines in the Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content in that they must portray accurately and equitably the cultural and racial diversity of American society, and Section 51500 states that \u201cteachers shall not give instruction and a school district shall not sponsor any activity that promotes a discriminatory bias on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation\u201d, or another protected characteristic;Whereas, Prolonged exposure to curricula that normalizes and perpetuates white supremacy, and the erasure of racial, ethnic, and religious minority groups can be alienating and traumatic for students and staff and contribute to the opportunity and achievement gaps we see today; now, therefore, be it,Resolved, That the Board of Education denounces the rise in anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, and anti- Israeli rhetoric and hate-motivated crimes and incidents that denigrate Jewish students and staff in the communities served by LAUSD in order for every LAUSD campus and office to be a safe and welcoming environment for all students, staff, and families;Resolved further, The Board declares the need for updated bulletins, curricular and instructional resources, and training for teachers, staff, administrators, students, and parents to address and prevent anti-Semitism and respond when anti-Semitic vandalism, bullying, harassment, or violence occurs either on campus or in the community, including specific reference to anti-Semitism in the mandated bulletins training at the start of each school year;Resolved further, That LAUSD will proceed with full implementation of the California-adopted History Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (2017) and its Appendix F on Religion and History-Social Science Education educate LAUSD students and all elementary, middle, and high school history-social science teachers about the positive contributions of Jewish peoples and to reduce anti-Jewish hate speech and hate-motivated behavior and incidents, and, be it finally;Resolved, That to accomplish these objectives, the Board directs the Superintendent to (1) direct all schools and offices to affirm the rights of Jewish students, staff, and families and to report acts of anti-Semitism in schools and the workplace using District procedures; (2) ensure that the Division of Instruction and Office of Human Relations, Diversity, and Equity establish a curriculum and professional development working group to recruit and compensate LAUSD teachers and administrators with expertise in the areas of Jewish history and culture and the Holocaust, and invite other expert groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, Simon Wiesenthal Center and J Street to update and revise any existing LAUSD curriculum, recommended grade level reading lists, or instructional resources to ensure they are inclusive and reflective of best practices and the full diversity of Jewish people including those in California and Los Angeles, and (3) report back to the Board within 90 days with an update on these efforts.",
