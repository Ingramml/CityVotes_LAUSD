    "language": "Whereas, Now more than ever before, internet access and reliable household WiFi connection is required to engage in essential services and meaningful experiences, including, but not limited to, health care, work, public safety, education, and connecting with loved ones;Whereas, The pandemic has illuminated the need to access high-quality household internet and appropriate devices to participate in distance and hybrid learning and to prepare all students for future success;Whereas, Families face barriers to access affordable, stable internet despite the limited free internet offerings made available during the COVID-19 crisis. Barriers include set-up capacity issues, service area requirements, prolonged wait times, substantial deposits in lieu of a provided social security number, future contract requirements, and in some cases, lack of knowledge by customer service agents;Whereas, Since the beginning of the pandemic the Los Angeles Unified School District has made a historic and commendable investment of over $100 million in student learning and connectivity devices, ensuring that students, teachers, and families have access to platforms that enable continuous online learning, and that teachers are trained to utilize these platforms for instruction;Whereas, The District has led the way in partnering with internet service providers, including its contract with Verizon, to provide access to free internet to students allowing for meaningful District savings and resulting in additional services and supports to high-need students; Whereas, Despite these efforts, some connectivity gaps persist among certain student groups and within specific neighborhoods. Lack of access to reliable internet at home may contribute to student participation rates and quality of experiences with online instruction;Whereas, Addressing the digital divide requires a long-term commitment to ensure students are given access to high-quality internet to successfully participate in distance and hybrid learning, receive access to necessary physical and mental health services, and prepare for 21st century success;Whereas, Nationally, school districts have taken the lead in bringing broadband internet to their students at home including the Chicago Connected, District, City and community initiative which commits $50 million to connect 100,000 students to broadband internet over 4 years; andWhereas, Connecting all families to high-quality household internet is complex due to the geographic differences in infrastructure and availability of internet service providers, as a result, reaching all families will require local, state and federal policy changes and investments in all available connectivity options (i.e. broadband, hotspots, LTE, cable, satellite); now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to evaluate (1) access to household internet connectivity (e.g. broadband and named service provider, District-issued connectivity device, etc.),  (2) adequacy/quality of service (i.e. strong, moderate, weak) among District students, educators and staff members who support student learning (e.g. teachers assistants, paraprofessionals, behavior interventionists, etc.), and (3) the extent to which internet connectivity is an obstacle to participation in remote learning through surveys, school-site developed tools, or any other means of gathering data and report findings to the Board every 30 days;Resolved further, That the Board directs the Superintendent to work with all government agencies to develop an action plan that jointly funds connectivity for all children and allocate up to $650,000 of funding to develop the plan to ensure every District student has access to the high-quality internet necessary for robust, uninterrupted participation in remote and/or hybrid learning, potentially including, but not limited to:\u2022\tCoordination between government agencies and community partners to assess and overcome household connectivity barriers, technology and otherwise, ultimately ensuring all available options for free internet connectivity for all in need;\u2022\tPilot programs to directly purchase broadband internet service at home for students in need, including recommendations as needed to re-evaluate existing policies limiting potential infrastructure changes on or near school campuses; and, be it finally,Resolved, That the Board directs the Superintendent to work with our city, county, state, and federal partners to gather data regarding providers, services, usage, and speeds and to work on ensuring there is free internet access to all students in need and to develop and report back to the Board within 120 days with a long-term plan, informed by data gathered and lessons learned by the District, State, and government agencies to ensure every student in the District has long-term internet access. The plan should include strategies for developing partnerships with local, state and federal leaders and expanded advocacy for dedicated State and Federal funds to support free connectivity for students and school staff.",

Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men; he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race, not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization;Whereas, Since 1976, the commemoration was extended from a week-long event to the entire month of February; Whereas, Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history; Whereas, The legacy of Carter G. Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), an organization now in its 105th Year; Whereas, The 2021 theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is \u201cThe Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity;\u201dWhereas, The Black family has been a topic of study in many disciplines\u2014history, literature, the visual arts and film studies, sociology, anthropology, and social policy thus making it a unifying theme for celebration in 2021; Whereas, While the role of the Black family has been described by some as a microcosm of the entire race, its complexity as the \u201cfoundation\u201d of African American life and history can be seen in numerous debates over how to represent its meaning and typicality from a historical perspective\u2014as enslaved or free, as patriarchal or matriarchal/matrifocal, as single-headed or dual-headed household, as extended or nuclear, as fictive kin or blood lineage, as legal or self- defined, and as Black or interracial, etc.;Whereas, The Black family offers a rich tapestry of images for exploring the African American past and present;Whereas, The\u00a0representation, identity, and diversity\u00a0of Black people have been reverenced, stereotyped, and vilified from the days of enslavement to our own time; Whereas, Black people continually remain optimistic and confident about the path ahead while leading the courageous, yet hard fought fights for the rights, liberties, and freedoms that many marginalized communities are now beneficiaries; andWhereas, Our democracy\u2019s founding ideals were false when they were written, but Black Americans have continuously fought to make them true; now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month;Resolved further, That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black Culture, Black Inventors, Black Artists, Black Artisans, Black Advocacy Black Leaders, and Black Civic Engagement; Resolved further, That the Board direct the Superintendent to convene a committee or working group to identify strategies and tactics to align resources targeted toward championing anti-racist educational practices and closing the gap of academic achievement outcomes for Black Students, and, be it finallyResolved, That the Superintendent will work with educators, librarians, all the schools of the District, and our wider community to recognize and celebrate this month with culturally relevant and appropriate curriculum, programs, ceremonies, and activities that generate in-depth discussion of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans.",
