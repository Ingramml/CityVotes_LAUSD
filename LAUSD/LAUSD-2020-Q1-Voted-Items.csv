Whereas, While various District efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually, there is still a large unmet need as 84 percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since 2017;Whereas, The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy, and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost;Whereas, In the 2018-19 school year alone, almost 50,000 students who failed a preliminary no-cost vision screening did not receive a follow-up exam, thereby potentially not receiving needed glasses because of missing paperwork;Whereas, In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administration’s cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices, some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions; this may include the District, despite the District’s wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District;Whereas, California Senate Bill (SB) 379, signed into law in 2017, helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites, stating that “if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school, a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment”;Whereas, This law permits “opt-out” consent for oral health assessments; yet the District has not implemented a policy to enable oral health services for our students through existing partnerships via this mechanism;  Whereas, The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their children’s medical care, while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment, and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary follow-up care with the proper health professionals, we can do more to ensure that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses; and Whereas, School districts in California, such as Compton Unified, Inglewood Unified, Pasadena Unified, Lawndale Elementary, Lennox School District, Lynwood Unified, Paramount Unified, New Haven Unified, San Leandro Unified, Natomas Unified, Alum Rock Unified, Redwood City, Monterey Peninsula Unified, Mountain View-Whisman School District, and Newark Unified have all implemented successful “opt-out” consent programs for student eye exams; now, therefore, be itResolved, That by the start of the 2020-21 school year, the District will implement a program and strategy to ensure the maximum number of students annually: receive 1) no-cost dental screenings, and 2) vision examinations and - if needed - prescription glasses that may be utilized by families from qualified providers, unless their parent or guardian opts out after express advance notice; and, be it finallyResolved, That the District directs the Superintendent to work with the Office of Government Relations, the Office of Student Health and Human Services, The Los Angeles Trust for Children’s Health, the State Department of Education, and the State Legislative bodies to pursue any future legislation to permit districts to implement health services programs, as well as to receive necessary funding for providing basic health services needed to improve educational outcomes.",FileMaker Resolutions DB;

Chavez was a true American hero, and the anniversary of his birth on March 31, 2020 provides a fitting opportunity to remember and honor his many contributions to social justice and equity; Whereas, In 1962 Cesar E. Chavez cofounded the United Farm Workers Union to contest poor treatment of workers in the fields, and sought to empower those workers by organizing the first union to acquire labor contracts for farm workers in the grape fields; Whereas, Cesar E. Chavez changed the attitudes of workers in the fields, and the nation far beyond, by leading them to live the La Causa slogan, “Si Se Puede”, by empowering all to fight for civil rights and to strive for justice for all minorities; Whereas, For more than three decades, Cesar E. Chavez led this groundbreaking organization by effecting social change through peaceful tactics such as fasts, boycotts, strikes, and pilgrimages; his union’s efforts influenced and inspired millions of Americans, forging a diverse national coalition of students, middle-class consumers, religious groups, and minorities in a hard-won struggle to achieve fair wages, medical coverage, pension benefits, humane living conditions, and perhaps most important, dignity and respect for the hundreds of thousands of farmworkers across the country; Whereas, Cesar E. Chavez believed that it is not enough to teach our young people to be successful, to seek achievement, and to make progress as individuals while forgetting about progress and prosperity for their community and while leaving friends and neighbors behind; he believed that our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others; Whereas, In 2000, the California Senate established March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day, a statewide holiday in recognition of the life of this outstanding Mexican-American labor leader and the contributions he has made; Whereas, The Cesar E. Chavez Day of Service and Learning was created for public school children to promote service to the communities of California in honor of the life and work of Cesar E. Chavez; Whereas, An array of American streets, schools and even a national monument are named after Cesar E. Chavez, including the United States Naval Ship Cesar E. Chavez which debuted in 2011; Whereas, Even after his death in 1993, his message of non-violence, unity, and justice of all people continues on today; and Whereas, In 2014 President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day in the United States, with Americans being urged to “observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor Cesar E. Chavez’s enduring legacy”; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District celebrates March 31st as Cesar E. Chavez Day to honor his legacy and will observe it on April 3, 2020; and, be it finally Resolved, That the Superintendent encourages students, staff, school administrators, teachers, and community members to implement service-learning projects based on his life, work, and values, and realize the full intent of the State-established Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning.",FileMaker Resolutions DB; Granicus Video Archives,2020-02-04,Monica Garcia,George McKenna III; Scott Schmerelson; Nick Melvoin; Kelly Gonez; Richard Vladovic; Frances Suavillo,

Woodson, a Harvard trained historian, like W.E.B. DuBois before him, believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice, and as a result announced “Negro History Week” in 1925 to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans; Whereas, It is commonly stated that Carter G. Woodson selected February as the month to host “Negro History Week” because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history, namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, whose birthdays are February 12th and 14th respectively; Whereas, Carter G. Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men; he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race, not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization;Whereas, Since 1976, the commemoration was extended from a week-long event to the entire month of February; Whereas, Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history; Whereas, The legacy of Carter G.
